1,Kindle,5,Ron Cronovich,"If you're trying to choose between a Nook and a Kindle, perhaps I can help. My wife and I have owned a Nook (the original one, not the new Nook Color), a Kindle 2, and a Kindle DX.   When Amazon announced the Kindle 3 this summer, we pre-ordered two Kindle 3's:  the wi-fi only model in graphite, and the wi-fi + 3G model in white.  They arrived in late August and we have used them very regularly since then.  For us, Kindle is better than Nook, but Nook is a good device with its own advantages that I will discuss below.  I'll end this review with a few words about the Nook Color.     First, reasons why we prefer the Kindle:    * Speed    In our experience, the Kindle is very zippy compared to the Nook.  Page refresh speed (the time it takes a new page to appear after you push the page-turn button) was WAY quicker on Kindle 2 than on Nook, and it's quicker yet on Kindle 3.   Yet, I read a whole book on the Nook and didn't find the slower page refresh to be annoying - you get used to it, and it's not a problem.      For me, the more important speed difference concerns navigation - moving the cursor around the screen, for example to pick a book from your library, or to jump to a chapter by selecting it in the table of contents.  On Kindle, you do this by pushing a 5-way rocker button, and the cursor moves very quickly.  On Nook, you do this by activating the color LCD touchscreen (which normally shuts off when not in use, to conserve battery).  A ""virtual rocker button"" appears on the screen, and you touch it to move the cursor.  Unfortunately, the Nook cursor moves very sluggishly.  This might not be a big deal to you, but it really got annoying to me, especially since my wife's Kindle was so quick and responsive.     In November 2010, Nook got a software upgrade that increases page refresh speed and makes navigation more responsive.  I returned my Nook months ago, so I cannot tell you if the Nook's performance is now equal to the Kindle's, but Nook owners in the comments section have convinced me that the software update improves the experience of using the Nook.  If performance is a big factor in your decision, visit a Best Buy and compare Kindle and Nook side by side.       * Screen contrast     You've seen Amazon's claims that the Kindle 3 e-ink has 50% better contrast than Kindle 2 or other e-ink devices.  I have no way of precisely measuring the improvement in contrast, but I can tell you that the Kindle 3 display definitely has more contrast than Kindle 2 or Nook.  The difference is noticeable, and important:  more screen contrast means less eyestrain when reading in poorly lit rooms.      In well-lit rooms, the Nook and Kindle 2 have enough contrast to allow for comfortable reading.  But I often read in low-light conditions, like in bed at night, or in a poorly  lit room.  In these situations, reading on Nook or Kindle 2 was a bit uncomfortable and often gave me a mild headache.  When I got the Kindle 3, the extra contrast was immediately noticeable, and made it more comfortable to read under less-than-ideal lighting conditions.  (If you go with a Nook, just make sure you have a good reading lamp nearby.)     * Battery life     The Nook's color LCD touch screen drains its battery quickly - I could never get more than 5 days out of a charge.  The Kindle 2 had longer battery life than the Nook, and Kindle 3 has even longer life:  in the 3 months since we received our Kindle 3's, we typically get 3 weeks of battery life between charges.  (We keep wireless off about half the time to save battery power.)       * Weight     Nook weighs about 3 ounces more than the new Kindle, and you can really feel the difference. Without a case, Nook is still light enough to hold in one hand for long reading sessions without fatigue. But in a case, Nook is a heavy sucker.   The new Kindle 3 is so light, even in a case, we find it comfortable holding in one hand for long reading sessions.     Reasons some people might prefer the Nook:     * In-store experience     If you need help with your nook, you can take it to any barnes and noble and get a real human to help. You can take your nook into the coffee shop section of your local B&N store and read any book for free for up to one hour per day. When you take your nook to B&N, some in-store special deals and the occasional free book pop up on your screen.     * User-replaceable battery     Rechargeable batteries eventually lose their ability to hold a charge.  Nook's battery is user-replaceable and relatively inexpensive.  To replace Kindle's battery, Amazon wants you to ship your Kindle to Amazon, and they will ship you back a DIFFERENT Kindle than the one you sent (it's the same model, for example if you send a white Kindle 3, you get a white Kindle 3 back, but you get a ""refurbished"" one, NOT the exact one you sent them).  I don't like this at all.      However, several people have posted comments here that have eased my concerns.  Someone looked up statistics on the Kindle's battery and did some simple calculations to show that it should last for 3 or more years.  Before that happens, I will surely have upgraded to a newer Kindle model by then.  Also, someone found some companies that sell Kindle batteries at reasonable cost and have how-to videos that demonstrate how we can replace the battery ourselves.  Doing this would void the Kindle's warranty, but the battery will probably not fail until long after the warranty expires.      * ePub      Nook uses the ePub format, a widely used open format. Amazon uses a proprietary ebook format. Many libraries will ""lend"" ebooks in the ePub format, which works with nook but not kindle.  However, a free and reputable program called Calibre allows you to translate ebooks from one format to another - it supports many formats, including ePub and Kindle.  The only catch is that it doesn't work with copy-protected ebooks, so you can't, for example, buy a Kindle book (which is copy protected) and translate it to ePub so you can read it on a Nook.      * Nook's color LCD touchscreen     The original Nook has a small color LCD screen on the bottom for navigation.  This could be a pro or con, depending on your preferences. It makes the Nook hipper and less drab than Kindle. Some people enjoy using the color LCD to view their library or navigate. I did, at first. But after two weeks of use, and comparisons with my wife's Kindle, I found the dedicated buttons of the Kindle easier and far quicker to use than the Nook's color touchscreen. I also found the bright light from the color screen distracting when I was trying to read a book or newspaper (though when not in use, it shuts off after a minute or so to conserve battery).     * expandable capacity    Nook comes with 2GB of internal memory.  If you need more capacity, you can insert a microSD card to add up to 16GB more memory.  Kindle comes with 4GB of internal memory - twice as much as Nook - but there's no way to expand that.  Kindle doesn't accept memory cards of any type.  If you mainly use your device to read ebooks and newspapers, this shouldn't be an issue.  I have over 100 books on my Kindle, and I've used only a tiny fraction of the memory.  Once Kindle's memory fills up, just delete books you don't need immediate access to; you can always restore them later, in seconds, for free.      A few other notes:     Kindle and Nook have other features, such as an MP3 player and a web browser, but I caution you to have low expectations for these features.  The MP3 player on the Kindle is like the first-generation iPod shuffle - you can't see what song is playing, and you can't navigate to other songs on your device.  I don't like the browser on either device; e-ink is just not a good technology for surfing the web; it's slower and clunkier than LCD screen technology, so even the browser on an Android phone or iPod touch is more enjoyable to use.  However, some commenters have more favorable views of either device's browser, and you might, too.      * ebook lending    If you have a Nook or a Kindle, you can ""lend"" an ebook you purchased to someone else with the same device for up to two weeks.  The Nook has always had this feature.  The Kindle just got this feature as of December 2010.  Most but not all purchased ebooks are lendable, due to publisher restrictions.      * PDF support     Kindle and Nook both handle PDF files, but in different ways.  When you put a PDF file on your nook, nook converts it into an ebook-like file, then you can adjust the font size, and the text and pagination will adjust just like with any ebook. But you cannot see the original PDF file in the native format in which it was created.  Kindle 3 and Kindle DX have native support for PDF files. You can see PDF files just as they would appear on your computer. You can also convert PDF files to an ebook-like format, and then Kindle handles them just the way the Nook handles them - text and pagination adjust when you change the font size. Unfortunately, some symbols, equations, and graphics get lost or mangled in the translation - even when viewing PDF files in their native format on the Kindle.  Moreover, the small screen size of the Kindle 3 and the Nook is not great for PDF files, most of which are designed for a larger page size. You can zoom and pan, but this is cumbersome and tiresome.  Thanks to commenters who suggested viewing PDF files in landscape mode on the Kindle (I don't know if you can do this on Nook); this way, you can see the entire top half of the page without panning, and then scroll down to the bottom half. This works a little better.    SUMMARY:     Nook and Kindle each offer their own advantages. We like the nook's user-replaceable battery, compatibility with ePub format, and in-store experience. But we strongly prefer Kindle 3 because its performance is zippier, its higher-contrast screen is easier to read, and it's smaller and lighter so it is more portable and more comfortable to hold in one hand for long reading sessions.     * Nook Color    Everything I wrote about the Nook in this review applies to the original Nook (which continues to be available), not the new Nook Color.  To me, the Nook Color is in a different product category than the Kindle or original Nook.  Nook Color has an LCD screen, like an iPad or most computer monitors.  That's a big disadvantage for people like me, who get headaches from reading a computer screen for long periods of time.  Amazon's Kindle product page has an informative section on e-ink vs. LCD displays.      But many people don't have problems reading from computer screens, and the Nook Color is getting glowing reviews in the press and by owners.  For the money, it offers a lot of functionality such as a good web browser and the ability to play games and watch movies.  But keep in mind:  it costs a lot more than the Kindle, it weighs nearly twice as much, it doesn't come in a 3G version, and (unlike the original Nook) the Nook Color doesn't have a user replaceable battery.",,,,,,
2,Kindle,3,Jeffrey Stanley,"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader.  I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.      My overall impression of the device is good.      The good:   I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book.  Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily.  The Kindle is incredibly light and thin.  I can hold it in one hand easily.  The page turn buttons are conveniently located.  Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font).  The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen.  There is zero eye strain in good light.  My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses.  I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase.  The ""experimental"" browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great.  It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs.  The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad.  It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.    The so-so:  The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options.  You can't sort by ""top rated,"" and there is no category for ""alternate histories,"" for example.  Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job.  The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.  You rarely need the wifi, but it is annoying if you change a setting, answer ""OK"" to the prompt to connect, and the thing tells you it failed to connect two seconds later (the exact moment it indicates that it did finally connect, then you need to go back to update the setting again).  Most settings don't require a connection, but it is a minor annoyance.  Most of your time will be spent reading, and of course your books are stored on the device and a connection is not required.  Part of me wishes I'd bought the 3G model, because the browser is good enough that having lifetime free 3G wireless would be worth the extra money.  Magazines don't look very good and are not very easy to navigate.  There is minor glare in some lighting conditions, mostly when a lamp is positioned behind the reader's head.     The bad:  The contrast is fair to poor in dim light.  It is much easier to read a printed page in dim light.  In good light, contrast is on par with a pulp paperback.  In dim light it feels almost like reading from an old Palm Pilot (resolution is better than an old Palm, but contrast is bad in dim light).  The screen is small enough that the frequency of page turns is pretty high.  Even in good light, the light gray background is less pleasant than the eggshell background of a printed page.  You must tell it to sync before you switch it off, if you expect the feature allowing you to pick up where you left off using other devices to work correctly.  The copy protection prevents you from using the files on anything other than Kindle software or devices.    Vs iPad:  IPad is a lot better for magazines, reference materials, and illustrated materials.  Kindle is worlds better for reading novels.  IPad is pretty heavy, making it more difficult to hold in your hand or carry with you everywhere.  Kindle is much more portable and easier to hold.  IPad has some amazing children's books and magazines, which take advantage of its multimedia features.  IPad is unreadable in sunlight and glare is bad in bright light.  Kindle is as good as a printed page in bright light.  Ipad serves as a creative tool, a computing tool, a gaming tool, and a communication tool.  Kindle is only a novel machine.  I don't regret buying either one of them.  An iPad won't replace books, but a Kindle can, if the book is text-only.    I highly recommend this device at its new low price if you are a frequent reader of novels.  I love my kindle.  Just don't expect it to be more than it is.  Leave the magazines and such to the tablet computers.",,,,,,
3,Kindle,5,C. Vincent,"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.       Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.     One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push `next page' for it to actually change. In addition, the web browsing feature was so slow and clunky that it is really unusable in my opinion. Two additions to the new Kindle have helped attenuate these issues. First, the pages do flip quicker (albeit, still slow in my opinion), and the addition of wifi has allowed faster connection for wireless activities (much better than only relying on 3G). I still can't see myself using the Kindle as an internet browsing tool or really doing much online aside from purchasing reading material, but the faster connection at least opens up the possibility - something that would only frustrate me on previous editions.     The new Kindle also offers a better contrast than previous editions and it looks fantastic compared to every other e-reader I have seen. I have no trouble seeing the screen in dim light or in bright sunlight - it really opens up the ability to read almost anywhere you are. Of course, you'll still need a separate light for extremely dark areas.      Another big addition to the Kindle 3 is that it offers double the storage compared to Kindle 2. I've never had a problem with the amount of storage since I can't possibly see myself filling up that much space (I don't put mp3's on it), but perhaps in the future, if certain applications or media files are put on the kindle, it could have been a problem. The additional space in the new model is definitely a welcome addition, but bringing back the memory card slot that was included on Kindle 1 would have been an even more welcome addition in my opinion.     Among e-readers, I definitely recommend the Kindle 3 if not just because it has a better size/form-factor, contrast, battery life, and speed compared to every other e-reader I have tried. On top of that, you get the wonderful amazon buying experience and selection for all your literature and can keep your kindle library intact between whatever other device you want to download a Kindle application onto.     The question of whether you need a Kindle vs another type of device for reading becomes a little more tricky and really comes down to what you want to use it for.    Do you want a device to read novels on, perhaps read outside, and have something very light that you almost forget it's there? Buy the Kindle.     Do you want something to lie in bed with for short periods of time while surfing the web? I might suggest going with the iPad, a different tablet, or a netbook.     Do you already have a Kindle 1 or 2? That's a tough one.... I don't think the new edition has enough `new' to it to warrant the upgrade in my mind, but some might value the new size and wifi capabilities even more-so than I do. For me, the new Kindle was a welcome addition to my family of devices since I didn't have anything anywhere near its form factor and convenience.     Should you get 3G + Wifi or just Wifi? I think this question can be answered simply by asking yourself if you travel a lot. Being able to buy books and access wireless content on the road is an indispensable option and well worth the extra money in my mind. Keeping the device mainly at home or near wifi hotspots really negates the need for 3G though.    Overall, I have to give the Kindle a 5 star rating because it does what it was designed to do very well, and in my opinion better than any of the competition. While the new features and capabilities aren't game-changing and truly outstanding, it is smaller, more capable, and better than any other e-reader out there. If you want `one device to handle it all', this isn't the place to look, but If you want a fantastic device solely for reading books, this is what you want.   ",,,,,,
4,Kindle,4,Matthew E. Coenen,"I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to ""compare"" the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges). I don't have a Sony e-reader. '    This will be a short, simple review.     I received my Kindle about a week ago and haven't been able to put it down.     Things I like about my Kindle?  1. The e-ink display is amazing.   2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.   3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.   4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)  5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.   6. Recharge time is fast.   7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!  8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.     Things I'm not too keen on?  1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.   2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.  3. Power button on the bottom? Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the ""bottom"" of a book on my lap when I read.     Things I hope change in the future?  1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a ""tag""), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually ""moved"", it's merely associated.   2. The look of the main screen. I'd like ""folders"" or some other way to display ""collections"".   3. Ability to create personal ""screen savers.""   4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this. Still, most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback/paperback counterparts. (And I'm not opposed to paying more for convenience and portability).    Things that don't bother me regarding other reviews?  1. The browser is experimental. Amazon has created a dedicated e-reader, and it's meant to be used to read. Period. Not browse the web. If you want to browse the web, get a computer -- not an e-reader.   2. The Kindle is not an mP3 player, either. Yes, it's nice to have some classical music playing in the background while I read, but I don't need to see the title of the song, album art, etc. (And you can skip from track to track on the Kindle using shortcut keys).  3. Lack of a ""color"" or ""touch"" screen.     In summary, for $139, I'm quite thrilled with my purchase and have arleady read multiple books on it. In fact, I think I've read more in the past week than I've read in the past month.",,,,,,
5,Kindle,5,Steven Gargolinski,"I just received my new Kindle, and my early impressions are very positive - it's definitely a solid step up from the previous generation Kindle. Check out my video review to see/hear more! UPDATE 9/7/2010: Hey guys - based on the comments received there are definitely some questions that people are interested in that I didn't touch on in my video review - so I wanted to take some time to answer some of those questions here. Hopefully this is helpful! ",,,,,,
6,Kindle,5,MikeCG,"It's no longer necessary to write about how desirable the Kindle is (or, for that matter, e-readers generally). Books and text and reading are with us to stay; only paper is becoming unnecessary. What we can discuss is how well a device performs its intended task(s), and how it compares to its competition on an absolute basis and for the price.    My wife and I share a last gen 6"" Kindle and just received a new 6"" display K3. I know, Amazon doesn't call it that, but how else can users refer to it?  In twenty words or less, it is an improvement over an already excellent product.  Smaller, but not too small to be held comfortably.  Same size display, but sharper and crisper, better contrast.  Easy to use, somewhat smaller keyboard that takes a little, but very little, getting used to. It took me a few hours to stop accidentally pressing some neighboring keys, but now using the keyboard is second nature. And the page turning buttons are silent, but have sufficient tactile feedback, excellent feel.    I found it very easy to duplicate our library from our older Kindle to our new K3, and to activate our home wifi. I don't like to say I ""transferred"" our books because that could be understood to mean they were taken from our old Kindle to our new one. I say ""duplicate"" because they reside on both Kindles.  The instruction manual is detailed and somewhat lengthy, but very understandable. (It's 200 pages, but don't let that scare you; it's easy to find the parts you need, and you will never need more than a few pages at one time.) The manual is published on the device, as in the past, and can also be downloaded to your computer as a pdf file so you can read the instructions from your computer as you apply them to the K3.    If you have wifi at home, which we do, when you are in range of a wifi that you have activated in your K3, it automatically uses that wifi, instead of connecting to the 3G AT&T network, assuming, of course, you have a 3G+wifi K3. It works faster on my home wifi than on the 3G network, so much so that if I had really thought it through before I bought it, or if I were to buy another, I would probably go wifi only and save $50. The only reasons to get the 3G+wifi model would seem to be if you don't have reliable access to wifi or if you travel a good deal to places that don't have a lot of wifi access, but do have AT&T connectivity AND you have need to download books or periodicals on a regular basis or without delay while you are away from home or office. If you can plan ahead and stock up on a few good books, and you have reliable access to wifi, such as at home/office, McDonalds or Starbucks, I suggest you think twice about whether you want the 3G+wifi K3, or the wifi only.    Each K3 has its own email address and you can send documents to it, including Word and pdf docs, and photos. Of course, the photos are B&W, but very detailed and clear.  The K3 permits surfing the web, although I haven't used it much for that purpose and, other than saying it works, I hesitate to pass judgment on how well I think someone who uses it for web browsing would like it.    I can't compare it to other dedicated e-readers because I haven't used them. People seem to be interested in how I think it compares to the iPad, which I don't own but have ""played with"" somewhat extensively at the Apple Store. My assessment is that there is no comparison.  The iPad will do much more, but as an e-reader I think the K3 is superior. I don't need color for reading text, the K3 is a fraction of the cost, and its smaller size makes it much more convenient to tote around. However, what kills the iPad as an e-reader, as far as I am concerned, is its weight.  I suspect most of us are the same in this regard, but I tend to read for an hour or two at a stretch.  A pound and a half doesn't sound too heavy, but I held an iPad for five minutes, literally, and my hands ached. It is simply too heavy to use as a book reading device, while the K3 is light as a feather. For reading, a cheaper and significantly lighter K3 as a dedicated e-reader is, IMHO, the way to go (compared to an iPad). BTW, a recent (in Aug. 2010) report from Taiwan said Apple in making a 6"" iPod, which, depending on size and weight, could change the equation. It will be interesting to see how the e-reader market develops. I said I can't compare the K3 to other competitors, and I won't, but I can say I am completely satisfied with Amazon as an e-book seller. I've only had a few occasions to need support (on my old Kindle), but that has also been entirely satisfactory.    Bottom line: my wife and I both like the K3 very much and recommend it to anyone considering buying an e-reader. I don't think you will regret buying one, with or without the free 3G.",,,,,,
7,Kindle,1,hgaphoto,"First, the good stuff. Kindle 3 has a very readable high contrast screen. The form factor is small and light enough to be a book replacement. Purchasing and downloading content is simple and convenient.    However, I had a series of problems which eventually led me to return my Kindle.    After unpacking and charging my Kindle 3, it refused to connect to my wireless network. I have a variety of other devices ranging from a Nintendo Wii to an iPod Touch and two computers that work just fine on my wireless network, but the Kindle couldn't connect after many attempts. I eventually gave up and turned it off. When I turned it back on several hours later, it had mysteriously connected to my WiFi network with the exact same settings that did not work earlier. I have noticed that several other users have ran into the same problem.    The next problem I noticed was that something was rolling around inside the casing. This is obviously not a good sign. Then, my Kindle 3 started freezing. The first freeze happened while using the experimental browser. As this is an ""experimental"" application, I wasn't too concerned. After a power reset, the Kindle came back up. The second freeze happened while playing Shuffled Row, which is a good game. After this freeze, my Kindle refused to reboot after many power reset attempts. (Yes, I did try keeping the power switch in the ""turn-on"" position for up to 30 seconds as suggested by the manual.) I eventually gave up and put it down. However, after a few minutes, the Kindle started to reboot itself. The was another freeze while reading a book, which was fixed with a power reset. I tried to contact Amazon for service, but it looks like the only way to get Kindle customer service is through a phone call.    And then my Kindle froze again while reading a book. This time, nothing would reset the kindle. When this last freeze happened, the battery was charged about 75%. At this point, there was no option but to return the kindle. There are some comments among the negative reviews here that the usual Amazon.com return process does not work. In my case, I was able to follow the regular Amazon return process and print a return label. So my Kindle is back to Amazon after less than a week of use.    Judging from other reviews that had similar experiences as mine, Amazon appears to have a specific quality control problem with this latest version of the Kindle. People may be more tolerant of the reliability other electronic gadgets, however, it is unacceptable for a product that is primarily intended to replace paper books to have issues like freezing and/or rebooting. After all, I never had a ""paper"" book freeze or reboot on me so far. Receiving a product with defects that should have been caught during testing before shipping pretty much destroys the ""Kindle experience"".    UPDATE (October 31, 2010): Since I do like the Kindle concept, after reading about the improvement in stability with the latest software upgrades, I purchased another Kindle WiFi. Everything was great for almost two weeks, no crashes. However, yesterday, the second Kindle also ended up with a frozen screen. After following through the instructions on Amazon's Kindle troubleshooting page and talking to the customer service, there was no way to get the Kindle out of the frozen state, so this one is also going back. The fact that this situation can happen to the same customer twice in a matter of few months indicates either a serious quality control problem or component reliability problem.",,,,,,
8,Kindle,5,Paladin08,"NOTE: Amazon limits the video size and duration, so I targeted what I thought were some key points. I check comments, so leave one if you have any questions not covered in the video or below and I'll try and answer. First off I love this device!! Like ipods are the king of MP3 players, this is the king of ebook readers in my opinion. I've been looking at this thing for at least 7+ hrs today and my eyes don't feel tired at all. If you want. . . * a low cost eBook * that allows you to read books * looks great * easy to setup * easy to hold/carry * easy on the eyes (no getting tired eyes from a glaring screen) . . . then look no further than this product! **Adding updates as I find other feature behaviors** - The comic I converted to PDF when emailed to my kindle email  address the conversion process didn't like it too much. Better to not use the conversion process for those types of PDFs. Other PDF's converted just fine. - Emailing PDF = the conversion process seems to cut off the cover page each time - Emailing and having amazon convert is fast. I like it! - You can plug the kindle into the USB, then ""eject"" it from the OS. This allows you to continue to charge the kindle and read it at the same time. You could also just plug it into an electrical socket and read from it too. - If you stop/pause your MP3 music it will start all the way back at track #1. This is not an MP3 player. It also plays the most recently added track first - 10 minutes it goes into sleep mode, but if you leave Wi-fi on = drains your battery quicker. Better to turn Wi-fi off when not using it - Buy a case to protect it and get yourself a light for times when you don't have enough light to read by. This is not a cell-phone screen, meaning you can't read it in the dark. The screen very much simulates paper in this case. - Manual even states...you cannot connect the Wi-fi to a corporate wi-fi. Most companies require VPN of some sort, which is not supported here. - Loaded a 25Mb PDF and when when trying to search I get the following error message, """"your search can not be completed as this item has not been indexed. Please try again later."" Found forum posts that said give the Kindle at least 10 minutes to complete indexing the file. . .longer if file if big. Sure enough, about 30 minutes later I tried again and was able to search this large PDF. ",,,,,,
9,Kindle,5,C. Stoneham,"I'll begin this review with the important caveat that I've only had my K3 for a day, so it's possible in a week, it will explode, leaving scorch marks on my hands and tears in my eyes. That being said, apocalyptic scenarios aside, this thing is amazing!    The ""feature"" that will strike you first is how small it is, especially if you're a K2 user. The width is perfect for a ""man's hands,"" being easily held between the thumb and middle finger. This isn't necessarily the most comfortable way, but it's a good sign of the size. Even my wife with ""woman's hands"" thinks it's far easier to hold than the K2 (not that the K2 was difficult, mind you). It HAS taken some time figuring out how best to hold it, since some of the K2 real estate is missing, but it's definitely nice to have something this small.    The weight is what'll hit you next. Or rather, it WON'T hit you. In fact, if you looked away, you might wonder if you were actually holding it. The K3 gives new definition to the word ""featherweight,"" and is a delight to hold for longer reading sessions. The K2 is like a brick compared to this.    The screen and/or speed are the ""last"" of the first impressions. From a faster boot up to richer blacks to snappier page turning to faster highlighting, the K3 does not disappoint. Text is sharp and crisp, and the screen refresh when turning a page is EASILY ""20% faster"" (I'd say twice that). The new fonts are an added benefit.    After these three ""first impressions,"" other things strike you at various intervals. The new 5-way navigation device is amazing! It's not as tactilely ""present"" as the K2, but defintely responsive and far less likely to break off. The ""rubberized"" back feels nicer than the K2 metal back and isn't slick or sticky, just the perfect amount of grip. The power button is larger and easier to slide (though it's on the bottom, which has resulted in a few ""tummy sleeps"") . The Keyboard is easier to ""thumb-type"" on. The graphite color only serves to further enhance the text. And there's a ""Back"" button at the left AND right!!!! PDF reading is much faster now, thought the 6"" screen is still the limiting factor.    The absence of numbers is a bit of a drawback, and I'm disappointed that Amazon didn't at least stencil in the numbers above the letters.     Overall, I've VERY impressed by the K3. The loss of the row of number buttons is a bit of a miss, but they're far less important than the letters and the smaller size. (Sure, you can hold down ALT and press the buttons along the top for numbers, but it can get annoying when you're counting in to make sure you hit 6, not 7)  Amazon really got it right this time, and at a price of $139, I can't see much reason NOT to spring for this one.    Happy Kindling!!!!    EDIT: One VERY important caveat on the Wi-Fi only version: it does NOT handle WPA Enterprise (as noted in Amazon's product description). For college students, this could be a deal-breaker. I'm lucky that my campus has an unsecured network, but if it didn't, I'd have no wi-fi options aside from home and the random Starbucks. I'm a bit frustrated by this (hopefully Amazon will address it with a future software update). WEP, WPA/WPA2 personal networks work fine.",,,,,,
10,Kindle,2,S. Le,"I love the new screen, the top menu auto hiding, the faster page turns, and the better rendering of websites but compared to the older Kindle 2, my new Kindle 3 has been crashing a lot.      At least 7 or 8 crashes where I had to force a restart and at least 2 times it has rebooted itself at random, it may have rebooted a few more times when I was not around to notice it!  (And I have only owned my Kindle 3 for three days now!)  I was very surprised because the Kindle 2 never crashed, with websites or reading books. Now my Kindle 3 crashes when I do either. At first I thought it was because of the new web browser, because that crashed on me a few times, so I tried to avoid the web browser, but then my unit crashed when I was reading a book I got off Amazon. And it even lost my place in the book, the Kindle 3 rebound back to earlier in the book after the crashes. At first I thought I was crazy reading the same thing over again, but now I know it's my Kindle losing its spot after a crash or self-reboot. It crashes regardless if I have the wireless on or off. I don't have it loaded down and I only have 7 books on it too. The older Kindle 2 still has most of my books. Honestly if I knew what was causing the crashes I would just avoid the problem and wait for a patch, but I currently have no idea what triggers the crashes. When my Kindle 3 works, I love it, but the crashes really make the reading experience frustrating.    Just FYI, I have a graphite 3G & Wi-Fi model and according to the settings page the software version is ""Kindle 3.0"". And wow, just as I type this the unit has just self-rebooted in front of me as I was looking at the settings page... Didn't even edit any settings...     The new Kindle is very buggy at this time...    **UPDATE 9/1/2010: Amazon called me yesterday because they read my post about my Kindle problems.  Unfortunately I was at work and didn't have my Kindle 3 at the time, but they did ask me to turn on the wireless as soon as I could so they could download the logs and analyze the problem.  They said they would call me back at a time that was more convenient, so I'm expecting to hear from them again about the crashing issue. It looks like Amazon takes this issues seriously.  I was very surprised they called me and it seems like very proactive support.  I am impressed.**    **UPDATE 9/2/2010: I talked to Amazon tech support again. The tech support rep was not able to tell me what was wrong, but he did say Amazon did get my log files after I turned on my wireless.  Amazon is going to exchange my Kindle.  I should have the replacement very soon.  Hopefully this will fix the problem.  I will post an update regarding the replacement Kindle.**    **UPDATE 9/20/2010: I received my new replacement Kindle 3 on September 3, 2010.  Amazon sent the replacement to me via Next Day Air.  Right away this unit seemed more sturdy.  The creaking of the unit went away.  So far the unit has still crashed on occasion, but with much less frequency.  The Kindle 3 web browser still crashes more than the Kindle 2 browser, but that is something I can avoid.  I'm able to access my webmail one day and the next day it will refuse to load and kick me back to the home screen.  Not sure why, but restarting my Kindle and trying again seems to help the web browser.  Overall the replacement Kindle 3 is very usable, perhaps my first Kindle was defected?  Either way, the continued crashing suggest to me that there is still some stability issues with the software.  One good thing to note is that amazon has come out with a new Firmware, 3.0.1, hopefully this will address some of the crashing issues.  I'll update my review when I have more time**    **UPDATE 10/26/2010:  I've been using the updated firmware for over a month now.  Much better.  I haven't really encountered a crash while reading in a long time.  The web browser is still buggy though.  I have a lot of issues with some sites causing the web browser to exit to the main screen (I would list sites but amazon doesn't seem to like that).  This is something I can forgive because the web browser is an experimental feature.  It's nice that the Kindle 3 can render pages better, but at the cost of stability.  The Kindle 2's more primitive web browser seemed to work better at the expensive of not looking as good.  Really all I want to do is be able to check my webmail on occasion, but I seem to have more issue with that on the Kindle 3 than I did with the Kindle 2.**    Also, I know they made the Kindle 3 cheaper but it reflect in the build quality.  The Kindle 3 is not as sturdy when compared to the older Kindle 2, the Kindle 3 case is plastic which is lighter but the frame fit has more play in it and my unit creaks when I press the keyboard.  It seems the interface between the front and back cover at the bottom will creak, especially when I press the spacebar.  This is sad because the Kindle 2 felt much more solid.  I guess this is a consequence of trying to lower the cost of the new Kindle 3.",,,,,,
11,Kindle,3,Linda S,"I have had the Kindle 2 and the Kindle 3 now. The Kindle 3 has some significant upgrades that really make it a lot easier to use.      Pros:     1. The smaller frame makes it much more compact for carrying around, and the reconfiguration of the buttons is nicely done, especially the scroll buttons.    2. The reader is great in the sun and easy to read with no glare  3. The wifi works fabulous, even with network keys, etc. that you have to type in to connect, Amazon made this easy to configure  4. The 3G is my backup for when I'm traveling, but honestly I really don't need it, and nor should you unless you REALLY have to have that book right that instant when you're on the road. In my experience this is rarely the case.  It's nice to have for hitting up wikitravel when you're on the road and don't have internet access.  5. Amazon has a wealth of books to buy online. They improved their online store interface a bit too, which I like because before when you hit back, it was a mystery where you'd end up.    Cons:     1. I am not a fan of the inline keyboard, because I'm used to typing on more a Qwerty interface from the Kindle 2.   2. They eliminated the numbers from the keyboard which is a bit of a nuisance.  3. The system reboots itself randomly every now and then, and forgets your page. Bookmark often and you can get around this problem. Also fortunately it only takes less than a minute to reboot.  The bad part is that sometimes it can reboot up to 5 or 6 times in a row.  That has really gotten on my nerves when trying to read.  Amazon should have not used Java but it works when it's working...  4. The browser is still ""experimental"" which means it comes riddled with bugs.  I have on several occasions tried to read some content (on Day 1 of ownership) and the browser will stay ""stuck"" on the screen. The system locks up way too often when using the browser to the point where I'm afraid to use it.  5. You still can't download books from a library with a DRM on it. That's amazon's way of owning their own proprietary book market.  This is frustrating, but there are ways around this that involve installing software on your computer and being clever. Google can help you with that.  6. The system locks up often too. Sometimes you have to sit and wait for it to catch up, especially when you're trying to use the browser.    Overall I love my Kindle but I had to dock it to 3 stars because of the shoddy operating system. I've only had my Kindle for 3 weeks and it has restarted itself almost every other day if not more.  Also, there once was a time, in my book the Kindle corrupted the text, and force restarted, then told me I needed to delete and re-download my book. That was very frustrating!!!!    Amazon needs to have a firmware update and soon. The restarting is so frustrating!",,,,,,
12,Kindle,4,J. Doherty,"Anyone that has ever surfed an eReader forum knows that the PRS-505 has been the long standing benchmark for eReaders. Why? Because it had the best eReader screen (which is why they have held their original MSRP of $300 on eBay and upwards of $199 for a used one). Sony didn't seem to realize what they had accomplished and even newer models can't compare to the screen that was used on the PRS-505. I've also frequently read that many people also preferred the PRS-505 screen to some of the earlier Kindle's. So... I purchased a PRS-505 (after returning my mistaken Sony PRS-600 purchase). I can say, it was true, the PRS-505 screen was beautiful and was even better than paper.    That brings us to today, I'm now an owner of a Kindle 3. I won't even bother comparing anything to the PRS-600 because it is just that bad (other than the convenience of the touch screen).    History lesson aside... In this review I will be comparing the Kindle 3 with the Sony PRS-505 because I know there are a lot of PRS-505 owners out there who might be wondering if it would be a good switch. Of course, as with all reviews, YMMV (Your mileage may vary), no warranties are expressed or implied, legal yadda, yadda...    Kindle 3 vs PRS-505  (I will abbreviate: Kindle 3 = K3, PRS-505 = 505)    -Screen Quality-  Winner: Tie  The K3 DOES have better contrast and I would agree with Amazon, it is about 50% better, so no complaints there at all. Grayscale is great and displays book covers, pictures, etc. better than the 505. However, the K3 does have a tiny bit more glare than the 505. When I say a tiny bit, I do mean a tiny bit. Even if I had a video camera, it probably wouldn't show up on camera. It is no where near as bad as the PRS-700 or PRS-600, but it should be known that there is that ever so little, miniscule amount of glare when compared directly with the 505. Personally, not enough to make me dislike the K3 and the increased contrast makes up for it... therefore it's a tie.    -Screen Functionality-  Winner: K3  Page flips are just faster on the K3 than the 505. Also, the K3 does a better job of updating smaller sections of the screen than the 505 did (i.e. Menus). It's simply more responsive, faster and during the white-to-black-to-white transition is almost unnoticeable if not natural.    -Controls-  Winner: K3  I did like the controls on the 505, however, I found myself getting a little uncomfortable with them when I read for extended periods (i.e. 6-8 hours). On the K3, I have not experienced that 'uncomfortableness' (not sure if that's a word but lets go with it). The K3 is still new to me so it's possible that I just haven't had enough time with it yet, but I think I've put in enough use to make that determination.    -Connectivity-  Winner: K3  Naturally, the K3 has wireless and USB. The 505 only has USB. Pretty simple, enough said.    -Battery Life & Charging-  Winner: K3  K3 definitely has better battery life (although, I could be slightly biased since the battery in the 505 is older, but I think the K3 has better battery life than even when my 505 was new). In terms of charging, it was nice of Amazon to include a wall charger. I have a laptop and don't want to leave my laptop on just to charge my eReader. With the 505, the wall charger had to be purchased separately. Plus, if you discharged the 505 too much then it took forever for it to start charging via USB and almost needed a wall charger.     -Memory Size-  Winner: 505  Sorry Amazon, the 505 clearly has the better memory platform (Internal Memory + Sony MemoryStick Slot + SD Card Slot). I don't think it would have been too difficult to implement a MicroSD card slot into the K3. Heck, the slots on the side for connecting the optional K3 cover are about the same size needed for a MicroSD card slot. The K3 does have 4GB on board but the MicroSD option to expand storage would've been nice (not to mention inserting the card into a computer card slot to transfer books between the computer and the device instead of the USB cable).    -eBook Store-  Winner: K3  It doesn't get any easier than the Kindle Store in terms of finding books and downloading them. Plus, the Kindle store has many titles that can be hard to find to purchase for the 505 (I know, I've already run into 3 titles that were ONLY available in the Kindle Store). Pricewise, the Kindle store is often cheaper than the Sony store making it an easy win for the K3 as well. (I understand that there are other stores available to purchase from, but the general audience isn't likely to hunt and peck every eBook store. They are more likely to shop at the eBook store that interfaces directly with their device and don't want to worry about formats, converting formats, etc.).    -Miscellaneous Pros- (that the competing device doesn't have or doesn't do well)  Kindle 3: Dictionary & Notes (a welcome addition over the 505 which the PRS-600 tried to implement but the screen was horrible), Web browser, automatic download of content (periodicals, newspapers, magazines)  PRS-505: Format flexibility (library ePubs, DRM ePubs), feels really solid    In the end, the Kindle 3 is a better device for me. There are some definite upsides to the PRS-505 which make it a good device as well, but the Kindle 3 has brought more of what is expected of an eReader today (newer technology) and put it in a package similar to that of the PRS-505 which makes it a good compromise.",,,,,,
13,Kindle,4,SerenityFL,"I have owned a K2 for over a year now and have really loved it.  However, when I saw the K3, (or next generation Kindle), was coming out and was able to find a few images and specs, I knew I wanted it.  I ordered immediately and began the long wait.    It was well worth it.    There is absolutely nothing wrong with my K2, it's still going strong and has never given me any problems at all but I had a number of reasons for ordering the K3:    Graphite- Yes,really.  I wanted something not white.  I think the graphite looks better and cleaner.  While skins are available, I found them to be a bit distracting so I'm very glad that Amazon gave us the choice to order white or graphite.      Size- The K2 is actually nice but it seems a little big, especially in a case.  I wanted something smaller and the K3 fits my hand perfectly.  It's like it was designed around my hand that's how well it fits.    ""Previous Page"" button on both coasts- I found this to be very important because it just feels right and it's necessary.  See, there you are, in bed, all propped up on pillows, comfy, holding the Kindle in your right hand, reading, while your left hand dips in to the bag of Peanut M&Ms.  You're reading along, engrossed in the story-you click the next page button and for whatever reason, miss something.  ""Wait, what?"", you say and you have to go back to the previous page to pick up that word you missed but now you have to take your hand OUT of your bag of chocolates to hit the previous page button and it disrupts the entire flow and pulls you out of your comfy little cocoon for a second.  With the previous page button on the right hand side as well, you don't have to stop using your left hand to shove candy down your throat, stop petting the dog or cat, stop twisting your hair, you just continue on, reading, using one hand.  The Kindle needed that button on the right side, they put it there, I could not be happier.    Placement of ""Home"", ""Menu"" buttons- While I may be used to the K2's button placement, the K3's home and menu button are where I intuitively want to press.  It makes more sense to me to have them by the keyboard.  This is where the bulk of the function buttons are, why have them spread out all over the place?  All in one little area.    The 5 Way Controller-  I am so happy with the new 5 way controller.  The one on the K2 stresses me out.  It's a little knob and I have been very anxious this entire time that I'm going to break it right off.  This was really noticeable when I started building my collections because I had to use that controller button a lot.  It took me probably twice as long as others because I was very careful touching that controller, delicately pushing it to the right or up/down.  The 5 way controller on the K3 works well, more responsive to the touch and I'm less stressed.  It may take some getting used to for some when using it to navigate up or down a page as the Menu and Home buttons are very close to those controls but for me, again, no problems.  LOVE it.    Contrast- Ok, I read all kinds of things about contrast when I first got my K2.  I, luckily, never had a problem with my contrast.  It always seemed dark to me and I never felt the need for a hack or to return mine because it was good.  Or so I thought.  When I got the K3, holy cow what a difference!  The fonts are so much darker, crisper, so much easier to read.  What an absolute pleasure!  They still have the grayish background and when I compare the two, the background looks almost the same color.  On the K3 it's just more...clear, really.  In fact, when I put my K2 and my K3 next to each other, I marvel at how I ever thought my K2 had dark fonts.  It looks faded, sun bleached, hard to read compared to the K3.  When they said better contrast, they absolutely meant, better contrast.  The K2 was already easy on my eyes but this contrast is even better for my eyes.  It's hard to tell from photos, you really have to see it in person.  Excellent job on this part.  Beautiful.    Wi-Fi-  I ordered the 3G/Wi-Fi because I'm not always going to be home when using my Kindle.  But I am so happy that they added wi-fi because this entire time, I've been mainly using the USB cord to do anything with the Kindle.  I've had to shop on my computer, send the book to my Kindle, hook up the USB cord, drag it to my Kindle...and no, it's not hard but you know, sometimes I just don't feel like getting out of bed to get the laptop and the cord and set it all up.  Sometimes, I just want to order the next book in the series without moving.  Oh yes, the Kindle is spoiling me and now, having the wi-fi, I don't even have to MOVE at ALL to get another book!  How grand is life?  The set up was laughably easy.  At first when it scanned for a hot spot it didn't detect mine but I don't take ""no"" for an answer so I made it look again.  It found my signal, I put in the password and now I can shop around in the Kindle store like everyone else, I can get on the web, browse around and get my books in 60 seconds, (or less), like all the others.  I didn't feel I had missed out on too much before with my K2 but now that I've been able to do this with the K3, I realize I have been missing a lot of the Kindle experience.  Thank you, Amazon, for adding this feature.      So those were the reasons I ordered this unit.      As far as weight is concerned, I'll be honest that I don't really notice much of a difference.  I do carry both in a case, maybe that has something to do with it but, seriously, they feel just about the same.  Also, I don't mind the number keys not being on the keyboard.  I never really used them anyway and it's a matter of hitting the ""sym"", (symbol), key to get the number menu.  I guess if you like to jump around to different locations it might get old but I have discovered there are ways to get around that.  (Find out which letters associate with those number keys and you don't have to use the symbol menu.)  But again, for me, not a big deal.    The previous/next page buttons are a little different but once again, these work perfectly for me because as I was reading on the K3, I noticed that I hit those keys towards the very edge anyway.  I picked up my K2 just to test and yep, that's how I held the Kindle so I don't have to put any effort in to turning a page.  And they are quiet.  No more, ""click""...read, read, read, ""click"", read, read, read, ""click""...you can't hear them.    And finally, page turns:  I put my two Kindles next to each other and hit the ""next page"" buttons simultaneously and they both turn at pretty much the same speed.  I really don't notice much difference there.    Anyway, my K2, as I said, still works and I'm keeping the K2 but this K3 is stunning.  It is glorious.  I absolutely love it.  I had enough time between ordering and receiving and I wondered if maybe I would send it back, maybe I could just keep using the K2, maybe I'm being a bit of a tech junkie...but that would be wrong.  There is NO WAY I would send this thing back.  It's absolutely wonderful.  I love it.  I absolutely LOVE the K3.",,,,,,
14,Kindle,3,Jabez Cooley,"The New Kindle has a lot going for it--low price, nice light weight and feel, rapid page turn, and access to a great bookstore that is extremely easy to use.  But as I professor, I have to warn students and scholars away from this device for anything other than pleasure reading.  And this is because Amazon seems to stubbornly refuse to make one simple fix which would make this useful to students and scholars--and that is including the print version page numbers in Kindle editions.  Instead, they have invented their own confusing ""location number"" system.  What this means for the student is this:  if you are in class discussing an assigned book, and the professor or another students refers to a page number in their print version, you are out of luck.  You won't be able to find it easily.    And for scholars it means that you might as well stick to purchasing the print version of any book you might want to cite in your own research, because you won't have an easy time finding the page number.  Sure, you could cite the Kindle edition location number, I suppose.  But since many of your readers are going to be using a print version, your citation will be useless to them.    Sony and many producers of Epub digital books have found a very simple fix for this:  place the print version page number faintly at the end of a line of text on the right margin.  It is completely non-distracting, but easy to find if you are looking for it. Why Amazon won't do this with Kindle books is beyond me.  More and more presses that cater to the academic market are releasing Kindle editions.  But the scholar or student who opts to save a few bucks or prefers the convenience of a digital text will find the missing page numbers a real frustration.",,,,,,
15,Kindle,1,annev308,"I'm on my third K3.  I had a K1, never got around to getting a K2, and was delighted to order a K3.    The form factor is excellent - small, light, the contrast is gorgeous, they finally have reasonable storage.    However, the first one crashed and froze and crashed and froze until it turned itslf off, although fully charged, and won't turn on again.  Replacement #1 has strobe effect - it sort of stalls out and blinks rapidly.  Replacement #2 freezes and restarts every time I try to turn the page.  On each restart it has a different number of items listed.  Sometimes it restarts just sitting there.  So 3 out of 3 have been bad.  This is the first day I've had #3, and the battery has gone from fully charged to 30% in 5 hours, wireless off.    Amazon now says it's a software issue, which absolutely makes sense, but it's hard for me to understand how issues of this kind got missed on testing.  This isn't (or shouldn't be) new to Amazon.  I expected issues like this with the K1, because that really was early adoption, but that thing just soldiers on, short battery life, dinky memory and all - at least it *works*.      So now, per support, all I can do wait and see if the update they're pushing in the next week will resolve all this stuff, and dread whatever new problems the update will bring.    At this point, the bloom is very definitely off the rose, and I'm not throwing away the box the latest K3 arrived in, because right now, I don't believe Amazon can make this right.  I very much regret how much of my content is tied to Amazon's proprietary format, and the only reason I'm waiting this out is because I've got 2 years of purchases in the Amazon format that I don't want to walk away from, but I'm getting there.  The longer this goes on, the closer I am to throwing in the towel with Amazon.    It's a lovely little device to hold and look at, but none of the ones Amazon has sent me work, so be very sure that you're willing to invest hours in calls and emails to support with no substantive result before you buy.       The folks at Kindle Support are being sweet, but honestly? I got the first K3 less than a week ago.",,,,,,
16,Kindle,5,Patrice Weaver,"I direct my review to those Kindle users who are still hanging on to their first generation Kindles as I have done.  Why trade up to a newer Kindle when I was still in love with the first one?  My Kindle has traveled all over Europe and out West with me and, although the battery was a replacement and the case had a small crack beginning I never saw the need to upgrade.  Until now.  At $189.00 I thought, why not?  This way I could share my old Kindle with one of my kids.  After 24 hours with my new Kindle I can honestly tell you this:  Trade up!  Trade up now!  The print screen is so clear you'd swear you were turning the pages of a book.  The time it takes to page through or look up a chapter?  Again, like you were paging through a book.  I love having the pages forward and back on both sides, the ease of tucking it in my purse or backpack, the lightness of it in my hand and the ability to read landscape or portrait.  Very handy for reading yourself to sleep!  No more groping in back to switch the Kindle or wireless on and off.  In every way I am pleased as punch with my decision to upgrade.  I have probably sold a thousand Kindles over the years because everywhere I go people will come up and ask me what I am reading.  I have always been a most enthusiastic representative.  I won't need to be now...this new Kindle?  It sells itself.  I know what everyone in my family will be getting for Christmas this year.  At this price, do yourself a favor and upgrade now.  You won't be sorry!",,,,,,
17,Kindle,4,monakh,"Review Summary:  *** When I first reviewed my Kindle three weeks back, it was extremely buggy, unstable and kept rebooting.  I am happy to note that most of those issues have been addressed but I am still testing the K3 ***    Ahh, I am compelled to write this review for two reasons, first and foremost, this is a FABULOUS device for readers.  I waited out the K1, and gifted the K2, but for myself, I opted for the 3rd Generation Kindle.  The second, I wanted to warn everyone about the pitfalls of being on the bleeding edge since when I first got the device it was not performing well at all.  However, that seems to have been fixed for the most part.  I do want to point out that I am still getting reboots but they are far reduced.  The last reboot occurred recently as I was browsing a .docx document that had been converted to .azw for the Kindle.    So the pros:    * Great contrast, this is my first e-reader so I am being spoiled by what is obviously a well-refined screen.  * Page turning is almost perfect (could be faster but at least it doesn't frustrate like some I have seen).  * The Kindle ecosystem is stellar. It took me less than an hour to get 20 books on my K3, three quarters of which were free as they were in the public domain.  Did you know everything from Little Women to 20,000 Leagues under the Sea is a free click away?  You will go crazy like a kid in a toy store with all the free books to choose from.    * I have the WiFi-only variant and it works perfectly for me (even with a hidden SSID and WPA2 encryption) here in the Middle East since I am an American expat.  * I really appreciate the 'mail documents to the free Kindle e-mail address' feature.  I have read tons of work-related and other PDF/MS Word documentation that I would have otherwise printed out or viewed on a PC.  It really is something that adds value to your life.  I no longer need my laptop everywhere.  I can read stuff on the bus that needs to be reviewed before a meeting.  Now, I just tell my friends (you have to authorize their domains or e-mail addresses in your Kindle account) to mail a document to my Kindle if they want me to look at it.    * The battery-life is stellar!  It lasts forever and ever.  A couple of weeks at least for occasional reading.  A week if you are a heavy reader and this is with the WiFi on (I always leave mine on).  * The web browser may be 'Experimental' but it works surprisingly well.  You can actually browse any text-based sites with ease and those formatted for mobility are even better.  +1 for that.  * 'Collections' is a good feature and a nice way to organize your stuff.  * The text-to-speech feature may be a gimmick and sounds mechanical but has great potential.  I can see why it has the audio book publishers up in arms, even though, to me, at the moment it poses them no threat whatsoever.  The mechanical male or female voice just cannot, as of yet, compete with the nuances and inflections that the human voice possesses.  * The mp3 playback is nice-to-have but I don't see myself ever using it, it's too cumbersome to move the files to the Kindle.  Even after you move the files, you can't see anything and you just have play and pause control over your recording.  No jumping through a 'playlist' or anything.  It's like an iPod Shuffle--without the shuffle...or feedback!    And now the cons:    * Kindle Dev Team:  What the EFF were you thinking releasing the firmware that came with the launch?  When I browsed the Kindle store after receiving my device--and I was counting--The K3 REBOOTED on me FIVE times. It did the same thing twice as I read 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.  And, of course, the WebKit browser is experimental so I don't mind that it also rebooted my Kindle twice.  Update:  This issue appears to be resolved.  My device is now actually usable for long periods of time whereas before it was not.  * After three weeks of usage, I find the back/forward buttons to be a bit too mushy.  They need to provide more tactile feedback.  * The accessories are a rip-off.  $59 for a case with a light?  Isn't that like almost half of what I paid for my Kindle?  Is that how much it costs to import?  Amazon, I want you to make money but come on, this is extortion!  It's almost like Amazon is trying the old hand of HP's InkJet Printers and the Ink Cartridge situation:  Sell the hardware ultra cheap and make up for it via the supplies.    * OK, fine you are scaring us with the dead author pics, but can you put them in the dozens rather than single digits?  Or, as another reviewer lamented, let us choose our own.  Or how about a world clock for crying out loud with an international dateline thingy majingy.  For me, I want to see everyone from Victor Hugo to Pearl S. Buck.  Come on guys, it can't be that hard, put the stuff up for free in the Kindle Store and let your customers choose if they want this...or that.    * This is a minor con but the overall speed of the device could use a 30% increase and I think then it would be perfect.  * I wish there was a way to make the cursor move faster from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen, it goes down (or up) one line at a time which can be frustrating.  * I can't seem to sort the Kindle Search results via price or reviews etc.  That may just be me, though.  Edit:  As the commenter below pointed out, I want to sort results by pricing because it's woefully difficult to find the free books on the Kindle Store.  Amazon, can you just make a 'Freebie Store' or whatever so we can browse that too?  Why make it so bloody hard?!  * Not all words show up with dictionary look-up.  A good example is the word 'herring'.  OK, I may know what it is, but my kid doesn't.  * Standard documents need to be converted before they can be displayed on a Kindle.  This, again, is not a huge con given what the device is primarily for, nevertheless this feature can add real value for those of us who regularly review cumbersome work-related documents.  If I could save trees by not printing 50 pages, I would love to do so.  You can email the documents to yourself at the free Kindle account and perform the same service for the sake of your environment.    I appreciate the fact that Amazon immediately addressed the problem of unstable Kindles by releasing a software patch within two weeks.  I must also give props to Amazon customer service that called me to inquire about my device based on some of my comments here.  Not only that, they put in a follow-up call after the patch was released.  When was the last time a vendor called YOU because you had a problem?  Two thumbs up!  To me, the Kindle is the best e-reader out there, and remains so in its 3rd iteration.  The rating has been upgraded to 4 stars :)    Happy reading and peace out!  ",,,,,,
18,Kindle,1,John Strong,"Let me start off my saying two things to be very clear:    1. I LOVE Kindle in general! We now have 3 of them in our family (nice for sharing books, which IS allowed if you are all on the same account, as we are). I bought Gen 1 for myself a long time ago, and it still works beautifully! I bought Gen 2 for my wife (who resisted for a long time), and she LOVES it. Finally, I bought Gen 3 (the newest) about 2 months ago for my daughter on her birthday....and this is where problems began.     So to be crystal clear: my review and the 1-star rating is ONLY for the newest (Gen 3) Kindle! Kindle as a concept and in general is 5-star in my book. But not this Gen 3!    2. Amazon customer service has been OUTSTANDING throughout the two month (and counting) ordeal. I definitely cannot fault them for what is happening, nor have I become upset with Amazon or the Kindle concept. They have been prompt, courteous, and helpful. They get a 5-star rating for service!    But...as you will soon see...the problem is STILL not resolved. Read on...    It is my belief that the Kindle Gen 3 (newest) has a significant design flaw, probably in the underlying software. Here again, let me be precise: The Kindle 3 ships with ver. 3.0.1 of the software. Very shortly after you first turn it on, you will get updated to ver. 3.0.2 which as of today is the highest ""release"" software out there. As a result of telephone troubleshooting, I have installed the very latest software (in beta) which is ver. 3.0.3. So this review applies to a Kindle Gen 3, with software 3.0.3 or older (the issue described below happened with all 3 software packages installed). I cannot speak for what happens if/when they resolve the fundamental issue I am seeing; which I suspect is in the software. I sure hope it happens soon, to remove the blemish from this otherwise outstanding product!    So what is wrong...?    Very simple: The unit will NOT come out of sleep state on a very regular basis. When you slide the power switch over to wake it up, it just sits there like Rip Van Winkle. No amount of sliding and waiting makes a bit of difference. The ONLY way to get control of the unit back is to do a full ""reset"" by holding the switch over for 15 seconds and forcing a reboot. Even then it takes 1-2 minutes to respond to this, and when it finally does awake, it goes through a full update/reset procedure that takes another 1-2 min. Oh, and when it is done, you have LOST all of your current locations in the books you are reading. Now, you can re-sync your placemarks from the server, but in my case I tend to leave the radio off (to preserve battery), and we share books at home, so syncing to the server produces very erratic results, and more time than not is useless. So then you have to crawl your way through your current book(s) again to find your place.    This happens at LEAST once per day; usually after an extended (a few hours; not days) sleep state.    So in a nutshell: the Kindle 3 (at least mine) does not wake consistently, and when it gets stuck (at least daily), it is a 5-minute process to get it back, plus hunt for your page again. This is, to say the least, VERY frustrating!    When this first happened, I phoned Amazon and got a very helpful tech support specialist. Together we walked through how to update the software to the beta version, in hopes that would eliminate the issue. It did not; the next day it was very sleepy once again.     I phoned Amazon again, and they immediately shipped me out a replacement for free, via overnight. And they sent me a free label to return the ""defective"" one. I was very pleased and hopeful.    Sadly, literally 1 day after registering the next Kindle 3, the EXACT same symptoms appeared. Exactly. I phoned, and we did the same software update. Nope, it failed again the next day. I phoned again, and they sent me a THIRD Kindle Gen 3 (free of course, and again overnight); plus the return shipping label. I think my UPS guy is wondering about now whether I am cornering the market on these things or something!     Well, you have guessed it by now...within 1 day the THIRD Kindle Gen 3 had also failed to wake-up, showing the identical symptoms. Yes, I phoned again, and we did the exact same software update...failed once again the next day. Sigh.    And that is where I am today: a Kindle Gen 3 that refuses to wake up properly, and the prospect of calling Amazon and having them offer to send me a FOURTH Kindle Gen 3. Oh my.     I believe electronics can have random issues and bugs, so I was not surprised with one failure. But THREE of them in a row??? No, the engineer in me (my profession) says this is more than just random bad luck; this is a serious design flaw. I have to assume some (even many) of them are working properly, or Amazon would have stopped shipping them by now; but I sure have not gotten a good one in three tries! So my guess is the design flaw is much more than a tiny fraction. The chances are just too remote, IMHO.    My one ""ding"" for customer service is I asked specifically all 3 times if there is a fundamental problem with Kindle 3, and I keep getting told: ""No, this is very unusual"". Well, for me 3 times in a row is more than unusual; it is a big problem. And I have since Googled the 'net on this issue, and now discover it is in fact quite widely reported in various user reviews.    What am I doing now?  I just bought a ""refurbished/repackaged"" Kindle *Gen 2* off eBay so at least my daughter would have a birthday present that works (and so far it does work beautifully!). And I am about to get on the phone again with Amazon to work out what we are going to do about this Gen 3 that is soundly sleeping right now in front of me.    To wrap up: I love Kindle, and I recommend it to anyone. BUT if you buy a Gen 3, I sure hope your luck is FAR better than mine, and you get one of the units that actually comes out of sleep state. And if it does not, know that you are not alone out there!    Good luck!",,,,,,
19,ipod,5,Scott Showalter,"Having had a chance to spend a little time with a review model gives me a chance to share the experience with you a bit early (before my own arrives). I'll take you hands-on with the new model, plus I'll share from my past two years of iPod touch ownership altogether, especially for those who haven't yet owned (or been owned by) one of these mobile gems.     I've also hidden a treasure trove of info on how you can legitimately download tons of quality apps for free. First though, let's quickly cover what's new.     + Faster 1GHz A4 Processor - to keep up with the high demands of multitasking   + Ultra high resolution ""Retina display"" - packs a 960 x 640 resolution at 326 pixels per inch   + 15% larger battery - 3.44 Whr/930 mAh plays 7 hrs of video & 40 hrs of audio   + Rear-facing camera - supports 960 x 720 sized photos (0.6 megapixels), plus 720p HD videos   + Front-facing VGA-quality camera - VGA-quality is a resolution of 640 x 480 (0.3 megapixels)   + 3-Axis Gyroscope - allows for higher precision and more motion gestures   + Wireless N - Connect faster and go farther than ever, with this WiFi device (requires a router with 802.11n)   + Built in microphone - but Apple reverted back to using the remote- and mic-less earphones   + Game Center - Apple's own social gaming platform   + Sleep/Power Button - it's been moved to the right, but not improved beyond that   + Thinner, lighter than ever   * Note - Memory remains at the same 256MB despite several unconfirmed sources touting 512MB. There's also no vibrate module.     Unlike last year's iPod touch update, this one's a complete overhaul to the entire line. Last year, the new models didn't change in appearance. On the inside, faster processors and double-memory were added to the 32GB & 64GB models, but the 8GB got left out. Not this time. Buying the new 8GB iPod touch indeed gets you all the new goodies. You'll also pay thirty bucks more than before, so consider buying the 32GB model instead. You'll get 400% of the storage capacity for only 23% more coin!       ===== Background =====     I'm a mobile app developer who's created a few apps and games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and now iPad. I was initially drawn to the iPod touch because of the popularity and capabilities of its mobile Web browsing--I was primarily a Web developer at the time and no other device could surf the Web so well. After I got one, I was hooked. I racked up over a hundred bucks in app purchases within the first month, and before long, I found myself learning how do develop native apps for the device.     Indeed, if you have never had an iPod touch before, you're in for a real treat. Of course, if you have, then you know first hand: it's is worth its weight in gold--no, in platinum. And now, with the latest generation, it may even be worth its weight rare gem stones! I digress.       ===== Out With the Old =====     The iPod touch is frequently called an iPhone without the phone. However, until now there have been several other features also missing in the iPod touch besides the phone: a camera, GPS, magnetometer (compass), and some newer amenities from the iPhone 4: front-facing camera, high resolution ""Retina display"" as it has been dubbed, and the powerful 1GHz A4 processor--indeed a necessity to keep up with multitasking.     That all changes, now. The 4th gen iPod touch brings with it some new features and amenities, some of which have been anticipated by iPod touch fans and developers alike, including myself, for several generations of the device. From a developer's perspective, the more hardware features we can get our hands on, the better and more innovative apps we can create, and the more users that can download, use and enjoy them.       ===== In With the New =====     The striking new design of the latest iPod touch is definitely a looker. Apple has made it even thinner (and I thought it was already too thin before) complete with a beautiful chrome back. While the super thin design is certainly attractive, I've found it slightly difficult to keep it well-gripped in your hands. The usual chrome back looks great too, but it's scratch-insistent. Yes, it's incredibly easy to scratch it all up, even after the first few days. For these two reasons, definitely get yourself a silicone skin (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0042GVG5G?tag=1pod-20&ie=UTF8) alongside your new touch!     For ages, the feature topping everyone's wishlist for the iPod touch has been a camera. Check! It handles HD video too--bonus! Granted, its not the 5 megapixel camera that the iPhone 4 sports, but again, the new iPod touch is thinner than ever, making it a miracle that we even got a camera in the first place, let alone two! Yes, Apple went the extra mile so we could make video calls with our iPhone toting friends, via their FaceTime app. Brilliant! So, having not had any camera on the iPod touch before, and now having TWO cameras on it, we can't really complain can we? Nah.     I'll have details on the quality both cameras later, but what excites me even moreso is the new much-higher resolution screen--dubbed ""Retina display"". You may not think much of it if you haven't used an iPhone or iPod touch before, nor have an older model nearby to compare it to, but for those that have and/or do, the difference is clear! (pun intended)     Where this really comes in handy is in browsing the Web and reading non-mobile-formatted PDF e-books. Now, I can see things so much clearer at the default zoom level (which shows the full width of a Web page or document). My vision isn't spectacular by any means, I just don't mind seeing things smaller on the screen. It allows me to see more content without having to scroll. Indeed, the Retina display was the #1 feature I never knew I wanted (until I saw it in the iPhone 4 that is).     Other newness includes: 15% larger battery, HD video recording and editing, built-in mic, wireless-n for nearly double the WiFi connection speed and distance, Game Center: Apple's new social gaming platform (which seems to be Apple's attempt to kill-off third party social gaming platforms like OpenFeint and Plus+), 3-axis gyroscope sensor, which complements the existing accelerometer sensor, both of which handle the rotating, swinging and other motion gestures of the device (previously, rotation were roughly calculated from accelerometer data), and new placement of the sleep/power button on the right (but still as difficult as ever to press).     Features still missing include: 512MB of memory, vibration, 5 MP quality camera + flash (iPhone apps now support using LED flash as a flashlight, like Android does), magnetometer (compass), and the GPS. I'd happily trade the thinness of the latest iPod touch to have the GPS. WiFi based location is often inaccurate, and the GPS doesn't need a WiFi or cellular connection, it just needs to see the satellites in the sky.       ===== iOS vs Android =====     So far, Apple has cornered the market of multitouch mobile devices that aren't phones, but things are slowly changing. Currently, the two hottest mobile and smartphone operating systems out there right now are Apple's iOS (formerly: iPhone OS) and Google's Android. Of course, iOS is popular because it runs on not only the iPhone, but also on the iPod touch and now on the ipad as well. Plus, it has garnered support from scores of app developers who've gotten behind Apple's slew of high-demand devices.     The iPod touch has really made iOS what it is today. It does a lot of what the iPhone does, without a contract, or carrier exclusivity, as is the case with the iPhone and the iPad (WiFi+3G models). So if it weren't for the iPod touch, a lot of the market share Apple now has in the industry would have been stifled by their carrier exclusivity. I think Apple will see the light soon, but that's another discussion.     Enter Android. Google has held a different stance on their mobile OS. It isn't tied to a select few devices, and it's open source, so it can be further developed by manufacturers who use it. Indeed, several mobile device manufacturers have now latched onto Android as a foundation for numerous devices. Wireless carriers that have been unable to carry the iPhone have also taken a liking to it. Now, tons of Android devices have been released, and there's no end in sight. Manufacturers have also seen the iPad's potential and now they want a piece of that pie, too. So, expect to see a lot more Android tablets and media-centric non-phone devices soon. The competition is heating up.     But not everything with Android, nor with iOS, is perfect. I own an EVO 4G, one of the most popular Android devices currently available. I've also used an iPod touch almost every day for nearly two years, so I'm pretty qualified to share my experience with each platform. Both certainly have their share of unique offerings, and neither of them are without flaws. For this reason, and because of the increasing competition between the two, I plan to dispel some of their key differences for you at various points in this review.       ===== So What Can the iPod Touch Actually Do? =====     Well, what can't it do?     The iPod touch is like a magical little box, only it's flat. While it cannot cook your breakfast, yet (I'm sure someone is already working on that), it can indeed do some pretty extraordinary things. It's an amazing catch-all device that can provide hours of entertainment, give you the power of the Web in your hand, and it can even replicate the functionality of countless one-off products. Developers have been creating apps that take advantage of special hardware of the iPod touch to emulate some other product for less, and sometimes even for free.     Even expensive products have seen cheap iOS based clone apps. For just 99 cents, you can snag a special alarm clock app that monitors your sleep cycle and wakes you up when you're in an ideal state of wakefulness. I spent 350 bucks on an aXbo   (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0014RDSSY?tag=1pod-20&ie=UTF8) a few years ago, who's functionality is easily replicated by several ""sleep phase"" alarm clock apps in the app store. When you do the math there, you see that it's easily a no brainer: buy yourself an iPod touch now!     I've listed more apps like this in the comments!     Plus, with the support of such a strong community of app and game developers, there's never a drought of fresh new apps and games. There's always something to do with the iPod touch, and I guarantee you'll never be bored with it. I honestly cannot say the same thing about Android, though I also tote my EVO 4G around with me. I do admit that the EVO's mobile hotspot comes in incredibly handy for providing the iPod touch with a WiFi connection while I'm on the go).     Now, with the proper resources, you can legitimately download thousands of high quality apps for free. I do it all the time and it is perfectly legal. See, Apple allows developers to temporarily put their apps on sale (and even drop the price to free). Usually they do this to get you to write some rave reviews for their apps. The secret to success is having the resources to help you spot these special app sales--so you know when and where to get them during their sometimes extremely-limited-time promotions.     In hopes of making this the most helpful review on Amazon for the iPod touch, here's how to obtain these special promotional-sale apps:     There are several resources you can use, both on the Web and on the iPod touch itself. I prefer to use the app called BargainBin that lists all apps that recently went on sale or dropped to free. It also supports watch lists with push notifications, and can alert you whenever an app you're interested in goes on sale. It's a phenomenal little gem, and it has gotten me a ton of apps and saved me a fortune! It also has a companion website that lists the same apps (Google: App Advice). There's also a website called AppShopper (Google it) that lists apps with recent price drops and new apps as well, and you can filter just the free products or just the sale products. The two sites don't always list the same apps. Sometimes one will miss something that the other will catch, so it's good to keep track of them both. Check them daily if possible. Several apps are duds, but you'll come across some really great ones from time to time. They'll all add up!       ===== Web Browsing =====     Alongside spending lots of money on all those wonderful apps in the App Store, Web browsing is one of the most popular uses for the iPod touch. Browsing the Web with mobile Safari was my original attraction to the device. The experience hasn't changed too drastically in the past two years (since the days of iOS 2), and while it's still very powerful, there are some definite flaws. And no, I'm not talking about Flash. Just minor usability issues I'd like to see overcome, but first let's look at the positives.     Mobile Safari has a smart approach to zooming in on content. Double-tap on a paragraph of text or an image to cinch that content right up to the edges of the screen. The downside: some sites aren't mobile-friendly, so zooming in on a really wide block of text can leave you with tiny text. You can zoom further manually, by using the ""unpinch"" multi-touch gesture, but because the browser doesn't have an option to reflow the text to the screen width, you have to scroll left and right, as well as up and down, just to read the text. Android's browser doesn't feature smart zoom, but it does reflow the text to fit the screen when zoomed in. It's a nice feature, and Apple should add it as a preference for Safari.     Browser history can also vanish after a few days, and browser windows get overwritten by links from other pages sometimes (usually when I've hit the maximum of eight windows). Also yet to be seen is support for doing common things like searching for text on a page, or bookmarking a link by tapping and holding. That would be invaluable for adding bookmarklets--bookmark based scripts that help overcome browser shortcomings.     Flash is also a great debate, one I won't get into. I will just say that all is not as it seems with the Flash-support-touting Android platform. Flash does work, but it is buggy because Flash doesn't play well with touch interfaces. Flash based video players don't work right, and I even run Android 2.2, which is supposed to have the ""full Flash experience"". It doesn't, trust me. So you're not missing much by not having Flash on the iPod touch!     Indeed, we can just hope and pray that Web developers and Flash-fiends see the light and start replacing Flash content with technologies like HTML5's canvas element, which is poised to take on a lot of Flash's most popular abilities.       ===== Media =====     Despite all the incredible things the iPod touch can do, audio and video are still one of the iPod touch's greatest strengths. And with the incredible resolution of the new iPod touch's retina display, to say that videos now appear much sharper, more vivid and highly-defined is definitely an understatement. Yes, videos were great before, but now they frickin' rock!     Just make sure your videos are at least 960 x 640. If you've owned an older iPod touch and used video conversion software to scale down your media to fit the old 320 x 480 screen resolution, definitely change your conversion settings, or look for a software update to support the new higher-resolution display.     For those interested in watching live TV on the go (over WiFi), Sling Media's SlingPlayer app, paired with one of their Slingbox devices is a phenomenal and freeing experience, especially considering your alternate choices for watching live TV on the go are pretty much nil up to this point.     On top of that, Netflix's recently released iPod touch version of their media streaming app has also been a much-welcomed addition to my ever-growing collection of apps. Netflix videos stream quickly, and even moving the play position back and forth in the timeline, the movie starts playing very quickly without much time rebuffering the video.       ===== Photos =====     The latest iPod touch is also a game-changer for photography and video recording on an iPod touch. It's not mind-blowing by any means, but we went from having no camera right to having two cameras on the device. I probably would not be so thrilled with just a new back camera. I merely would have sighed, mumbling ""finally"" under my my breath (unless it were 5 megapixels). But despite the less-than-one megapixel quality of the rear-facing camera, I was taken aback by the rather decent quality, especially in low-light environments. Check the comments for links to sample photos!     Between that and the ability to connect with other iPhone and iPod touch toting friends via Apple's FaceTime app, yes... it's a game changer. Granted, I have been wanting front facing cameras on mobile devices ever since mobile devices started having cameras period. I got the first of such devices when my EVO 4G arrived in June, but as they say: the more the merrier. Friends, welcome to the future we've been dreaming of. Video killed the audio call!     The quality of my test calls were pretty good. Of course, it was over WiFi, but it proves the cameras are decent. You can switch from using the front camera to using the rear camera, too, in case something was going on in front of you that you wanted to share. Just tap the ""camera swap"" button in the bottom right corner of the screen. FaceTime also rotates along with the iPod when flipped on its side, nice.     HD video recording is the other half of the aforementioned game-changing equation. I didn't expect to see ANY video recording, considering the original iPhone camera was originally just a camera. But it's here, complete with HD quality (yes, the quality is indeed desirable), plus basic video editing support, as well as support for Apple's brilliant ""iMovie"" app: an advanced video editing studio right on your iPod touch. It's just five bucks on the App Store.       ===== E-Reading =====     The iPad has been making waves in the genre of media reading for several months now, but that hasn't exactly been the same story for any generation of the iPod touch so far. Granted, it's not exactly marketed as an eReader like its iPad counterpart, but there are some really great apps out there for media reading on it, so there's no reason not to use it to read digital media. The obstacle to doing that, for me at least, has been the limited screen resolution, and so that may all potentially start to change, now that Apple has brought the Retina display to the iPod touch.     The 163 pixels per inch screens of past iPod touches were still pretty great, just not ideal for tiny text. For comparison, LCD monitors typically only have 96 pixels per inch, and CRT monitors only have 72 pixels per inch. TV's are even worse than that. What this means for you is that the iPod touch display has always been sharper than your own computer monitor.     However, despite being able to display content at a higher quality, I still found that in a lot of eBooks, especially PDFs that weren't mobile-formatted, the text was just not clear enough to be readable when zoomed out. However, zooming in meant having to constantly scroll side-to-side while reading. The app ""Good Reader"" helped ease that pain by doing the left-right & vertical scrolling for you with just a tap of the screen, as well as offering an additional view that re-flows the text to fit on the screen at a large enough size.     However, with the Retina display, all text and content in the aforementioned ""zoomed out"" state now appears extremely clear. That is a wonderful thing, so long as you don't mind reading tiny text.     Could you still benefit from having an iPad too? Perhaps. After all, it does have unique qualities that set it apart from the iPod touch, as my in depth iPad review portrays (http://www.amazon.com/review/R16U71KO7POLA2?tag=1pod-20&ie=UTF8). But unless you specifically see the need for one of those unique qualities, then no, you probably don't need both.       ===== Gaming =====     If you're like me, you probably don't have time for games. Regardless, it may still be high-time to let the kid within you roam free from time to time, as I do. The iPod touch has made it possible. In fact, it is so easy, there's no excuse not to enjoy yourself. My favorite games are the racing games and, when I have a bit more time, strategy games.     With the iPhone and iPod Touch having taken on a clear role as a gaming console that has been as revolutionary for mobile gaming as the Wii was for living-room gaming, it goes without saying that the iPod touch is, and will continue to be, one of the best platforms for gaming. It's simple, convenient, and pretty much instant. Whenever you have a few moments of free time, wherever you're, just turn it on, find your game, and bam! You're gaming. Simple as that.       ===== Productivity =====     Productivity carries numerous definitions. Usually its ""getting something done"" though some people tend to believe that it's the ability to focus without being distracted, which I see as one of the iPod touch's strengths, at least for me, primarily because the screen is small enough to force you to focus on the task at hand.     In the context of software though, Apple's own suite of productivity apps for the office, collectively called ""iWork"", has been further refined for the iPhone and iPod touch. Because of the aforementioned ""focus factor"" of the iPod touch, I have found myself to be surprisingly productive when working on documents with it. There are three apps in all: Pages allows you to work on word processing documents. Numbers allows you to work on spreadsheets. Keynote lets you work on presentations and slideshows (including PowerPoint files).     So far, I've found these apps to be highly useful when I have work to do, but don't feel like being at the computer to do it. Another great app for that is ""iTeleport"" which let's me at my computer remotely, when iWork won't work (meaning I'm not working on office documents). Log Me In Ignition is another similar app that is slightly easier to set up, but a bit slower than iTeleport, when you're just working over the same WiFi connection as the remote computer.     Furthermore, there's a whole category of iPod touch apps in the App Store specifically dedicated to productivity. Some of my favorite productivity apps include: Bento (info management), Things (project management), iTeleport (remote computing), and GoodReader (best PDF reader around). Search for them in the App Store.       ===== Email, IM and Social Networking =====     The iPod touch has been, and continues to be an exceptional communication-machine. Whether it's reading or composing email, keeping in touch via instant messenger, or managing your life via social networks, you've got plenty of options here.     Instant messaging is easy with platforms such as AIM, Yahoo, Gtalk, MSN, Skype and apps that handle multiple platforms: IM+, Fring, Nimbuzz, BeejiveIM and Fuse Messenger. Finally, multitasking means you can truly remain connected to your IM platforms of choice, instead of relying on apps to keep you signed remotely, then push new-message notifications to your device. This is a much welcome addition to the new iPod touch.     As well, there are plenty of apps to help you browse and update your status on social networks like Facebook, Twitter, etc. Within the iOS development community, Twitter apps have often been a laughing stock, simply because there are so many out there on the App Store. They're almost as rampant as ""fart"" apps. So to say you've got countless options as far as social networking apps are concerned is probably a pretty accurate statement.     For email, you need not look any further than Apple's native ""Mail"" app. Even if you're using Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, or Apple's own MobileMe, setup is a snap. It even supports Microsoft Exchange, often useful for corporate email setups. As well, any other email accounts that support POP3 or IMAP connection types will work with the Mail app too. Plus, new to the iPod touch with iOS 4 is the option to use a unified inbox--handy for those already used to that behavior on Mac OS X.       ===== Downloading Apps and Games =====     Downloading apps on your iPod touch couldn't be easier. Once you set up your iTunes account with a credit card, all you need to do is find the app you want, tap the download button (usually it says the price rather than ""download"", which then changes to ""buy"" after you tap it), then tap again to confirm. Voila, you just bought an app. Behind the scenes, Apple then charges your card the amount of the app plus tax, while you're already off enjoying your new purchase. This ease of access is a blessing and a curse, because you can easily empty your wallet if you're not carefully considering each purchase.     All apps in the App Store range in price from Free and 99 cents on up, always incrementing in whole dollar amounts (1.99, 2.99, 3.99, etc). The maximum price for an app is set to $999.99, of which there are only eight currently priced so outrageously. And don't even think of toying with them. Apple does not allow refunds on apps you have purchased--all sales are final!     Contrast that with Android's more complex Android Market, and you'll find several more steps, especially for paid apps. For one, there're no fixed pricing tiers, and secondly, they allow multiple currency pricing, which only confuses its users. The good developers do keep their pricing similar to iOS apps, with the 99 cent base plus $1 increments, but I often see apps priced at 0.55 or 0.79 or $1 or 2.95 ...it's quite disorienting and unstructured. They have also set their price cap at $200, so you can't accidentally run up a $1000 charge on just one app--you'll need at least 5 apps for that. ;)     Meanwhile, to actually buy an app on Android, you must tap the BUY button, confirm that you want to buy the app, then get redirected to a Google Checkout link, where you must setup your Google Checkout account or choose an existing payment method if you already have an account set up. Once you confirm the purchase yet again, THEN you can finally download the app.     Google also makes selling apps a bit more complicated for developers than Apple, but I won't get into that. I'm just stressing how absolutely simple Apple makes the app buying and selling process. Contrary to Apple however, Google does allow users to ""return"" purchased Android apps within 24 hours for a full refund. That's nice.       ===== Technical Specifications =====     Since Amazon's product descriptions tend to be lacking, I like to include all the technical jargon geeks have come to expect when researching new gadgets.

Android doesn't even come close.   + The Retina Display - Phenomenal! Kudos for bringing it to the iPod touch as well as the iPhone. Now try it with IPS technology Apple!   + Wireless-N, finally! - Faster and farther-reaching WiFi connections (if your router supports 802.11n)   + High performance 1GHz A4 processor - provides all the power of the iPhone 4, a win for gaming and multitasking.   + Multitasks like a dream with iOS 4 and the powerful processor, despite the same 256MB of memory as the third generation touch.   + Rear camera - It's not the 5 megapixel iPhone 4 camera, but I definitely can't complain here. It shoots great photos, especially in low-light without flash, plus it can do HD video.   + Front facing camera - What a pleasant surprise! Now it just needs to work with Skype.       ===== Dissappointments =====     + No GPS - IP based location just doesn't cut it at times. GPS has no subscription fee or contract to use. GPS chips are costly, but tons of high cost GPS apps are in the App Store now to offset that cost for Apple.   + 256MB memory - iFixit has confirmed this disappointing flaw, putting to rest all the rumors of 512MB still littering several reviews.   + Still no 120GB model - Useful for higher res videos that look great on the Retina display.   + No USB 3.0 or wireless sync - Sync'ing can be slow or inconvenient over the cable.   + Thinner design - I was hoping for a more squared design, like the iPhone 4, as it is easier to grip, handle and press the power button.   + Power button - Yes, it hasn't changed much. It's been moved to the right side on this model, but it's still the tiny, hard-to-press button it's has always been, and if you take lots of screenshots like I do (by pressing power+home simultaneously) half the time you end up closing your app because the power button didn't work right.       ===== The Bottom Line =====     It is absolutely clear: Apple has definitely blurred the lines between iPhone and iPod touch with its 4th generation of both devices. Since it has no contract or carrier exclusivity, this phenomenal device will continue to shine its light in the otherwise dark voids of the smartphone market where the iPhone cannot go, even without the phone. That's just smart!     Given all my tips, I think you'll find the iPod touch to be an extraordinarily useful, possibly even highly addictive device, with a price tag that is well worth it, especially the 32GB model. With all the things that the iPod touch can do, it will undoubtedly enhance your life and change the way you interact with the Web. It might even make a gamer out of you if it hasn't already, it sure did for me!     I hope you've found my hands-on review helpful. I do actively participate in any discussions via the comments, so feel free to drop me a line, or ask me any questions as well. :)",,,,,,
20,ipod,5,MWebb,"My original review focused on whether you can successfully use an 8 gb version of this 4th gen iPod Touch in lieu of a more expensive, larger memory version. My conclusion (at the end of this highly revised review) was, and remains, a resounding YES but there is one aspect, that applies to ALL the iPod Touch 4th generation editions (8/32/64 gb), that I now think is MUCH more important:    The quality of the screen display.    Simply put, this device has near-iPad screen quality in a 3.5"" device. (960x640 resolution at 326 pixels per inch, vs. 1024x768 resolution at 132 pixels per inch).    That means you can get almost iPad quality video in approximately 3.6 ounces of device vs. 24 ounces of device; in a device that fits a shirt pocket vs. a device you need a separate bag for. In a device you can hold up as a reader vs. a device that tires your arms.    This Touch is VERY practical for reading NYTimes articles or USAToday articles in their reader applications, optimized for this size display (crisp, large type). VERY practical for browsing the regular on-line editions of most newspapers (tap once to fit a column to a screen with nice readable type). GREAT for YouTube since the YouTube app included with the device is optimized for delivering high def YouTube content - if available, HD videos are automatically preferred. GREAT for Netflix and Hulu Plus. GREAT for gmail and ok for Facebook (I am sure FB will make its dedicated app more user-friendly in the future).    Great, for me, for online banking and stock research/trading.    Great for catching up on tech websites in their ""mobile"" formats.    So-so for Yahoo; I don't like Yahoo Mobile right now and their regular online edition, via the built in Safari browser, doesn't scale up and down as nicely as the online NYTimes does.    And oh yeah, the device can store adequate amounts of your own music library (or stream Slacker or Pandora, customized for you, in free or pay editions) and download iTunes paid video content for later consumption, stream to Apple TV, or you can move your own DVD content to the device via easy conversion programs.    Last year I ventured out on some vacations with an iPod Touch, the last generation, as a ""backup"" to my netbook. I found myself easily reading emails, but preferring the netbook for replies. I didn't read any books with it until earlier this year, and was surprised by how well book reading worked. I Skyped home.    When this new generation Touch came out, I got it as a matter of reflex, justifying the purchase on the basis of the built-in camera and built-in microphone (which means I don't have to use ""inline mics"" with ear buds any more). But in reality, the sharpness of the screen  is MUCH more important. I have now, simply as a result of this device, switched to e-reading from print reading. On the road, this has largely displaced the netbook (except for reviews like this); most friends communicate in shorter emails these days anyway, and most emails are ads and blurbs, not stuff you need to reply to.    But now at home I find myself ALSO using this new generation iPod Touch a LOT. In the morning to check emails for anything really important, to check NYTimes headlines, before I even roll out of bed. Anytime I want to check emails or Facebook the rest of the day, without firing up the regular desktop computer. At bed to read.    In short, the darn thing is a working computer. Great for CONSUMPTION, patience-testing for INPUT. (Although forcing my input to slow down, say, for Simple Notes entries may be a good thing - forces me to slow down and be a lot more concise.)    ***********A word on gaming and pricing. My kids have the 8 gb, 4th gen (this one) model and LOVE it for games. The motion detector is VERY responsive and watching a 3.5 y.o. use ""dual thumbs"" on the screen blows me away. You will NOT get the same screen responsiveness and motion detection on an Android device. Some developers are even reluctant to develop Android versions because the hardware for Android devices simply has too many variants in the marketplace vs. much smaller overall market share. This can change, but for now Apple dominates the gaming market. This week Apple is offering the Touch in 8 gb mode for slightly over 2 bills but with a 25 gift card. The value for dollar is incredible. Think carefully before you try to find a substitute! (FWIW I love Apple hardware but don't like the ""locked down"" system it has become - I hate having to use iTunes as ""Grand Central Station"" for Touch operations. So I am actually inclined to be biased AGAINST Apple, but in the case of the Touch the results are simply too good to ignore.)      ***********Best accessory ever: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00305GWRM"">ClassicReader Three-pair Valu-Pac, +3.00</a> The screen on this new generation of iPod Touches is very, very sharp, but in order to enjoy all that sharpness, you need to bring the screen really close to your eyes (assuming you don't have presbyopia and can focus close) OR simply carry a pair of cheap reading glasses as an ""accessory"" to these super sharp 4th generation screens. This lets you actually read the tiny type on the NY Times website, actually see the richness of colors and depth of detail on a video. So even if you don't need reading glasses for magazine reading, CONSIDER trying a pair of STRONG reading glasses (1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, or even 3.0) to magnify the 3.5"" display screen. Strong reading glasses make high-def YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu Plus videos POP for me.    My original review, edited to be slightly briefer, is below, so you will know where most of the pre-12/20 comments come from:    ______________________    Can you get by with an 8gb Touch?    Yep, based on my experience with a 3rd gen 32 gb, and on my recent local purchase of the 4th gen (this current model) in 8 gb capacity.    When using the old 32 gb, I found out that I barely used its greater storage capacity. (I don't haul around a lot of music or videos - I just transfer what I want to listen to/watch for each road trip or listening/viewing cycle using iTunes). Apps, I discovered, don't take up much space, even games and books don't take up much space, unless you want to haul substantially more of your whole collection with you. Amazon's Kindle app is esp. device friendly, since you can archive books you've finished back to Amazon instead of keeping them on the device. iTunes is a great way to manage what content you want to store on your home computer - which becomes a sort of large ""docking device"" - and what you want top take ""to go.""    As a netbook substitute, storage isn't even that important. I can check my bank balance, transfer funds and execute orders on a brokerage account, listen to radio on Pandora or Slacker, watch music videos (and a lot more ) on YouTube, Skype, stream Netflix, and do a whole lot of other stuff on the 8 gb just fine.    In fact in hindsight the only real reason for me getting the 32 gb version in the older edition was to get the faster processor. But in the current generation, ALL THE 4th GENERATION HARDWARE IS THE SAME, except only for memory.    Do keep in mind on the 8gb edition you give up about a gig to systems operations, leaving only 7 gb or so for your stuff. And you need to leave from for apps and their space. I probably wouldn't put more than 6 gb of music and videos on the 8gb version. The other editions also give up the same space, but proportionately it is a smaller ""hit"" to your storage.    The 8gb makes a nice intersection on my personal ""cheapness"" and ""minimalist"" curves. The price doesn't get into nose-bleed territory where I start to wonder whether a netbook would makes more sense, and it's inexpensive enough to subject to the toils of daily wear and tear - keeping it handy in an outside day pack pocket, instead of more safely stowed deep inside the pack.

21,ipod,5,D. C. Hanson,"Alright, so Best Buy got the 32GB iPod Touch 4G in stock so I drove an hour to go get one. I was not disappointed. I will run through the features I have come across so far.    Body: Aside from moving the sleep button to the right and making the back of the device slimmer and more flat, not much has changed. Yes, the chrome back is still there erg! It was so pretty for the first 30 seconds.    Ram: The Ram on the iPod Touch is only 256 MB, so do not believe the talk of 512 MB, it is simply not true.    Wireless: Fully supports A/B/G/N    Vibration: There is no vibration, so do not expect that.    Multitasking: Works real well and very smooth transition    Display: While the display on the iPod is not IPS like the iPhone do not think it suffers in anyway. This display is so beautiful and crisp to look at. I cannot even distinguish the pixels, and text on a website is like you are reading out of a book, it's so refreshing. I played a digital copy of ""UP"" on here and the colors practically jump off the screen, very nice. Apple's icons are so much more vivid and sharp, while 3rd party developer icons who have yet to make an upgrade for the new displays shows what a step up this new screen has to offer.    Speaker: I am not sure of the quality of the speaker on the 3G iPod Touch, but on my 2G iPod Touch it was very tinny and I only used it for game sound. Here on the 4G there is a new spot on the bottom left for the speaker and it has risen in clarity. Music is very listenable and clear, however nothing replaces a good set of earbuds, but when you're in a jam, you won't be gritting your teeth with this speaker.     Processor: The new Apple processor is a sure win for this device. Everything loads very fast and switching from one screen to another is very swift and smooth. Crash Bandicoot finally has a nice framerate to play with on this iPod and for once I did not regret buying that game.     Front Camera: This is the camera that is primarily used for Facetime. It's resolution is at 640 X 480. After taking a few pictures with it, you will notice how it is really not for taking stills, but works fine for videochatting (which I have not tried, but did run some video tests with it). Obviously Facetime will work better in well lit areas, but then again, doesn't any camera?    Rear Camera: Again stills are just so so. What really bugs me is when you go to take a picture, you see how crisp the preview is, then you take the picture and you can see it blur. The tap to focus works nice for adjusting exposure and well lit photos look very decent on the display. It's when you upload them to your computer when you notice how not so decent they actually are. While this may be a negative for many people, if you are like me, you want to just upload photos with this device to FaceBook and capture funny moments with the video camera. If I want to take a really awesome picture, I'll pull out my DSLR, but for me this iPod's capabilities are more than adequate for my quick shooting of certain events. The video captures quite nicely, while not superb like an actual HD camcorder does enough for me for again, capturing fun moments. Don't worry, you don't cringe while watching the video, it's more than adequate and produces vibrant colors and a fast framerate. Some may complain on this, and believe me those reviews will be here shortly, but then again why not buy an HD Camcorder that is made for HD content? (I'm not ignorant to HD quality either, I'm a huge fan of it. I run a 3D 65'' 1080p display with Blu-ray and Dolby Tru-HD decoding surround sound system)    Microphone: Testing out Skype my friend told me I was coming in loud and clear. I also played back a video I made on the iPod on my computer and the microphone captures top notch audio. Very crisp and clear, I was quite pleased.    Battery: While I haven't tested out Apple's claims of 40 hr. of music, let's be honest who really does that? I'm sure Apple's claims are quite credible in their battery life depending on how the device is used.     One note I should also make, my iPod Touch 2G accessories, (car charger, wall charger) work with my iPod touch 4G. Apple sometimes changes stuff like the charging pin on the iPod's to make a person have to buy new accessories. Anybody remember when the iPod Video A/V cables had the Audio and Video switched around so people couldn't use their cables with the iPod? Well they could, they just had to switch the audio and video cables in the port around. Anyways, away from this funny piece of marketing history.    Is the new iPod worth it? For me, upgrading from the 2G Touch, yes! The display is brilliant, the speed of the processor amazing, video quality is very much enjoyable and the rear camera is excellent for taking quick fun shots. If I had one word to describe this iPod, it would be fun! You can't handle one of these without feeling like a joyous kid, (I'm 22) and the business aspect is still there and quite useful. I would highly recommend this iPod Touch as a worthy upgrade to any generation of the iPod Touch you may own and if you don't own one, there has never been a more perfect time to go out and get one! Don't hesitate to leave a comment here if you have a question for an actual owner. I'll do what I can!      ",,,,,,

23,ipod,3,J. Austin,"My wife and I have the 3rd generation iPod Touch and are very happy with them. The one thing that I have been missing/wanting is having a built in camera. I recently saw the photos taken by a friend's iPhone and was blown away by how good they were. Almost all reviews have said the iPhone built in 5MP camera is excellent.  Like many others I watched Steve Jobs present the new iPod line today and was very excited to hear that it had all the features I was looking for. Retina display - awesome. Front and rear cameras - yes! Finally.    I was all set to order 2 from Amazon the minute Amazon had them listed. But .. while looking thru the Apple website I came across the specs for the rear facing camera. It is only .7 megapixels. Less than 1 megapixel. What? I thought that can't be right. I contacted Apple and the rep, who had gotten many such calls it seemed, confirmed that the iPod touch has  a very different camera (.7 MP vs the iPhone's 5 MP) . Bummer. I looked around and found a hands on review of it .... and they said the sensor itself, besides being lower MP, is also not nearly as good as the one in the iPhone. Not terrible but certainly not good and no where in the same league as the one in the iPhone.    The camera was one of the 2 main things people asked for. The other being the Retina display. My assumption is that Apple didn't want to affect iPhone sales and purposely dummied down the camera. Shame on them. They want us to pay $240 to $400 for an iPod with a terrible camera.    I first predicted that w/ the Retina display and the camera that this would be a smashing success, a huge seller coming into the holiday season. I suspect when people get them and see how bad the photos are, they'll be returning them to Apple. Or like myself, not upgrading.    I realize this review should be for a product I own, but I felt it was important for people to know about the camera before they ordered it. If photos aren't a big deal, and you'll only email them or post them on facebook, then .7 MP is probably fine. If you want to print any of the photos you take, or even have room to crop the photo, you won't get enough resolution to do that.    That being said, the Retina display does look awesome, but is it worth the extra dollars over the price of the 3G model? Only you can decide that.    I hope this helps all of you make a wise decision about your purchase.    08 Sept 2010 Update  Hello everyone. First, I am glad that my raising the above issues helped many of you. Second, for those who lashed out at me, perhaps you should take a look at why you get so angry at a stranger who simply encouraged you to look and think before you buy.    Here's an update.[...] has posted a hands on review of the new iPod Touch. You may want to google it or go to their site to read it.    In summary:  1. Retina display is darker and not nearly as good as the one in the iPhone. ""Definitely not an iPhone w/o the contract"".  2. HD Video is actually pretty good  3. Size is a lot smaller than the 3g, bad if you have normal or large hands, ok for teens and those w/ small hands.  4. Photo quality is much worse than the iPhone. And their posted photos show how much worse. Forget trying to print them and I'd argue not even good for the web based on their samples. No focus or zoom capability either, you can only adjust brightness.    There you go. We are staying w/ our 3g models, there isn't enough here to justify taking a huge loss selling them and buying these new models. And given that the camera and retina display aren't nearly the quality of the iPhone, this is certainly a release we'll sit out.    I hope this has helped.",,,,,,
24,ipod,4,JaSoN,"I've been using an old Iphone 2.5g as my ""ipod touch"" for about the last year or so.  I switched to Sprint for the cheaper rates so no more iphone coverage.  Well, since the old phone is not compatible with IOS4.0 and since this new device is seemed truly ""next-generation,"" I decided to take the plunge.  I hate the lack of space on my old iphone (8Gb) so I splurged for the 64.  Here's a few things I noticed right out of the gate:    1)  The screen resolution is phenomenal.   The lighting sucks.  It has a nasty angle of view.  If you look dead at the center of the screen with a black screen ""on,"" you can see slight brightness variances from corner to corner.  Not terrible, but I had expected better.  After researching it a bit, this is apparently because Apple ""cheaped-out"" and did not include the IPS style of lighting that they used on the Iphone 4.  Oh well, still a great screen though.    2)  Size:  The device is amazingly thin.  This is both good and bad.  The buttons are kind of hard to mash as they are located on the heavily beveled edges of the device.  It's not bad, but, you do need to have a good grip on the device when screwing around with volume or power.  It is super light and fits well in my hand though.  But, as weird as it seems, i do hate how the apple logo feels under my finger.  Feels like I have super glue or something on my finger tips... strange    3)  Speed:  The speed of the device is great.  This is comparing it directly to my old iPhone though.  It blows it out of the water.  I don't have to really wait on anything.  I do wish the browser was better though.  On my old phone, when I'd scroll too fast on a large page, i'd get the checkerboard effect.  I hoped this was no longer an issue with the new A4 chip.  Again, after researching it, I found that the iPod touch has half the RAM of the new iPhone 4.  Guess that would explain it.    4)  Camera:  The camera is crap.  It's low res and has poor low light performance.  It's cool for impressing Grandma with the Face Time app, but that's about it.  Don't leave home without a good cell phone camera (or a Nikon/Canon!)    5)  Minor quibbles:  I miss my vibrate/loudness switch.  Sucks not being able to instantly mute the device when i want it quiet.  I also wish the speaker were more full.  I am glad that Apple included a speaker at least, but, for it to be useful as a Face Time device for Grandma, the speaker really needs to be made louder/fuller.    in a nutshell, it's a great device, but it is the Kmart special of the new Iphone 4 in pretty much every way.  Why did I give it 4 stars when I'm so harsh on it?  Because, no other device even comes close.  Apple has managed to make the Ipod Touch feel magic in every way.",,,,,,
25,ipod,4,Steve H,"iPod Touch had never included a camera prior to this September 1, 2010 update.    The lack of a camera was one of the significant aspects that kept the iPod Touch from feeling more like an iPhone.      Now, this iPod Touch has two cameras, reason for celebration?  Not exactly.  The usability of the cameras included is minimal.      The iPod Touch does have significant upgrades.  It now features a similar display to iPhone 4, which Apple dubs Retina Display.  It is twice the resolution, and looks oh so gorgeous.  Honestly, I have never used a display that looks as crisp as Apple's Retina Display.  Steve Jobs had described it as looking similar to the text in a high quality book, and I would have to agree.  You must see it, to see the difference.  Therefore, the display in the updated iPod Touch is a significant upgrade.      Secondly, the iPod Touch will feel much snappier to you than the previous generation. The reason?  It now includes the same Apple A4 processor that is found in iPhone 4 and iPad.  It's snappy.  Applications launch with much improved speed, multitasking works easier and so forth.  The processor may not make the device look different, but it's a significant feature update.    Next, to the cameras.  Both the front and rear camera can be used.  The front camera is similar to the iPhone's front camera, VGA only, which is rather low resolution.  However, Apple knows the front camera would primarily be used for Face Time.  Face Time allows you to make video chats with other iPod Touch (the new ones) and iPhone 4 users.  You must be connected to WiFi to make these video chats.  The Face Time icon is presented prominently on the home screen of the iPod Touch.  I have had access to Face Time for several months, with my iPhone 4.  It is very cool and works surprisingly well.  The problem is finding other users on the compatible device (right now only iPhone 4 and iPod Touch 4th generation) plus them being on WiFi at the same time.  Over time, the feature will be more useful as more members of your family and friends have a compatible device.  However, you simply don't always want to have a video chat with people either.  Sometimes voice or even text is enough.  Therefore, the front camera is not a total bust.  It can be used to try out Face Time, which some users will probably find useful as least on occasion.      The rear camera on the iPod Touch is the disappointment.  The rear camera is not even 1 megapixel.  The camera is 960x720 resolution.   Therefore, for still images the quality is quite low.  After all, it's not even 1 megapixel.  The iPhone 4 camera is 5 megapixel.  Is the camera a total bust?  Well, it can take HD video, because HD video is actually lower resolution than still digital cameras.  The quality of the HD video it takes will need to be judged by the user.  The camera's optics are simply not the same as used in the iPhone 4 due to the thinness of the iPod Touch.  Therefore, camera quality is significantly lower compared to iPhone 4.  However, you can take a video and edit it on your iPod Touch.  It probably won't look as good as someone who takes a video on an iPhone 4 though.      Overall, I think highly of the new iPod Touch.  The iPod Touch most attractive features are still there, indeed it will do many of its best features, better than ever thanks to the fast A4 processor now included.  Gaming will be quicker and web browsing will be snappier all thanks to its faster processor.  For me, these are uses most buy the Touch to do.  Play games and use it as an internet device for browsing the web or reading email.  The touch is still a winner in these categories.  Highly recommended.  In terms of being a music player, iPod Touch is as great as ever too.  You can continue to touch the screen to select your music and view cover art.  No change there.  40 Hours of Audio Playback.  Video Playback is somewhat improved!  The faster A4 processor allows iTunes HD videos that you purchase to be played, and the retina display makes them look oh so gorgeous.  The cameras are the only small disappointment.  The front camera is ok, but how often will you Face Time?  The back camera's quality and specs are simply not up to the level many have come to expect due to mobile phones' cameras getting better over the years.  However, Apple chose to make the iPod Touch thinner than ever!  That thinness limits the cameras that will fit into the device.      This 64 GB model is great if you need the most storage possible for Applications, Videos, and Music.  Many will find the smaller capacities equally as compelling.  The only difference is storage space.      The iPod Touch is still a solid value.  Cheaper than an iPhone and with no service contract.  A big plus for many especially teens and kids.  iPod Touch is now as fast as the iPhone and has the gorgeous Retina display that the iPhone features.  It's a winner.  Some may only be disappointed by its cameras.  Still, very much recommended.",,,,,,
26,ipod,4,Rose M. J.,"I'm like most people and I'm disappointed that after all this time, Apple still sees fit to treat their iPod Touch customers as second-class citizens - finally giving us a camera, but not much of one. iPod Touch people have been waiting for years for the camera, and it's like Apple threw us a gnarly old bone. Sigh ...    I was also disappointed about the RAM. Ok, I accept that it would have made the price higher, but at least give us a choice. One with less RAM, and one with more RAM but more expensive.    But the thing I was most horribly disappointed with of all, was the change of form factor. Why, Apple?? I now have a couple of hundred dollars of accessories that can't be used any longer. In addition, after writing to a few manufacturers, I don't think we're going to see much for the new iPod Touch. I understand why - because there is nothing else that has the same form factor, so less chance of selling enough to make it worthwhile. Apple, did you have lots of complaints about the old form? I doubt it - so why?    Anyway, I have still given the iPod Touch 4g four stars, because it is still the best/only thing out there like it, and there are a ton of great new features. The camera is still a camera, we now have video, FaceTime, better screen resolution, and many other things that made it worthwhile to buy.     So the new iPod Touch, is bittersweet. Sweet, because it really is. Bitter, because it could have been so much better. Apple knows it has no competition with the Touch, so they can play as many games as they like with it. Shame on you, Apple.    BTW - I had no problems with the shipping time. It arrived several days before it was supposed to. Thanks Amazon.",,,,,,
27,ipod,5,Steve Sack,"OK, folks, this will be my first Amazon review, though I've bought countless other things from the site.  My 64GB G4 is on order, and I'll update my review after I've had some time to play with it.    Whereas I agree that the rear facing camera is not what I was expecting, I have to say that the overall improvements from the previous generation are spectacular!    I would rate the previous 32GB G3 Touch at 6 stars if I could.  And here's why.    The screen is awesome.  Great battery life.  Barely noticeable in your pocket.  It's a book reader (get Stanza)  Surfs the internet  Hold my full CD Library (350 of `em)  Plays Movies  Does Email well.  Holds all of your family photos.  Reads PDF files.  Store and edit MS Office files with QuickOffice.  Does calendaring well.  Games are awesome.  Supports Telnet, RDP and VNC for my job.  Quick access to weather  Very nice Maps Calculator, Alarm Clock, et. al.    To me it seems to do just about everything!    Now comes the G4 Touch.  What are you really getting with the upgrade?  Well, from a hardware standpoint, I've noticed the following improvements from the G3 model....      I thought that 256MB Ram becomes 512MB, but Sysmon still reports that it has 256MB ((Rather 247MB)  ARM Cortex-A8 833 MHz (600MHz) CPU becomes 1GHz (800Mhz) with same GPU  L1 cache 64 KB (was 32KB)  480x320 screen becomes Retina 960x640  LED screen Lighting  Added 802.11n support  Gyroscope added  Front facing 640x480 camera added  Rear facing 1280x720 camera added (960x720 stills for 4:3 aspect)  Battery life increased by 33%  Microphone added  Photo exposure sensor added  Thickness reduced by 20% (1.6mm)  Weight reduced by 12%  (14g)    To me, this is a rather impressive list of improvements on an already mind-numbingly cool product.  Yeah, I wish the camera was 3+ Megapixels, but truthfully, I mostly just look that the photos that take, but rarely want to print them out anyway, so this is not a deal-breaker.  With the G4, I'll now be able to add the following to my list of things that I can do with my iPod....    Record 720p video.  Make video calls (cool, but we'll see if I use it)  Edit my Video.  Take photographs.  Record audio without digging out my headphones. (Finally)  View photos and movies that look like photos, instead of pixels.  Use it longer before recharging.    In summary, I believe that an iPod touch is something you buy, love intensely for a year, then throw away in favor of the new model.  (That is, if you can afford to do so).  I'm upgrading my 32GB G3 to a 64GB G4 to hold more games and home movies, mainly.  The Retina display alone would have been reason enough for me to upgrade.  With the impressive list of upgrades above, it made the choice very easy for me.      I won't complain that the digital camera that's built into my high-def camcorder isn't as nice as it could have been.  (But I won't begrudge anyone for doing so themselves -- this is a free country that we live in!)      ps.  Maybe the G5 will have GPS....  It'd be nice to replace my Magellan and TomTom with and iPod.      *Update*  Now after having some time to play with the new iPod touch here is what I've found.    *The new form factor is very nice.  Of course it's thinner, and the silver bezel around the screen is greatly reduced and it makes it look a much nicer.  You do feel like you are holding and handling a redesigned and improved product.    *Surprisingly, it only has 256MB or RAM, or at least this is what the Sysmon app reports on the device.    *The Display is revolutionary. Being able to read that tiny tiny text is just amazing.  Who would have thought that they could, or would, manufacture a screen that is so detailed!  Photos now look like real photos!  Games look wonderful and surfing is greatly enhanced by the new display.  Movies look better too.    *The video cameras are a very nice addition.  Tap on something on the screen to set the exposure.  This sometimes works quite well, but don't expect great video in low light situations.  Double tap the screen when in video mode on the back camera to change your video aspect from 4:3 to 16:9 and back.    *There is now an app button for Facetime, Camera and Game Center.  I don't use the game center so I can't comment.    *The Photos app now has a camera roll where your photos and videos are saved.    *I've noticed that the device gets much warmer when you use it with the brightest screen settings.    *Overall performance is better than the 32GB G3 model.  Noticably better but nothing earth shattering.    *Finally a microphone!  I've taken my voice memos app out of hiding and actually intend to use it now.    *It is a bit louder than the previous model.  Not much, but noticeably so.    Overall, I am very happy with my new iPod.  The lack of more RAM and additional heat that it generates are the only issues that are noticable to me, and the redesign, screen and the cameras are what really help to set it apart from the previous models.    If you've never owned an iPod Touch before, now is the time to buy one.  You are sure to fall in love with it.  If you are thinking about upgrading to the new version, consider that the screen and the cameras are the standout new features.  If you don't care so much about taking photos and video on you iPod, the retina display might just be enough to make you want to get the new model.",,,,,,
28,ipod_c,5,Steve H,"The updated iPod Classic was probably the least exciting of the new iPods announced in the September 2008 update, but that does not mean it should be dismissed.     I own the 160 GB iPod Classic that has now been discontinued, but there are few differences (perhaps the biggest being the much slimmer shape of this 120 model), and I did get to check this updated 120 GB version out at the store, when picking up the new nano and touch.     Firstly, the 120 GB version is again smaller than the largest capacity available last year, but it is a single platter hard drive, which allows it to maintain the slim shape of the 80 GB version from last year. More storage, a hundred dollars less, and just as small. That is progress despite calls from others that the classic isn't exciting. It still serves its purpose as the original iPod idea. Big capacity in a simple to use device.     Next, the software has been slightly updated on the iPod Classic. It now includes Genius, like iTunes and the other new iPods. This allows you, when on a song you enjoy, to select the genius feature. The iPod will then compile a list of songs (playlist), which goes together with the original song you were listening to. This helps you rediscover music in your library, with a playlist to fit your mood at the time. I have been using the genius feature for a few days now, and it is impressive the way it compiles these playlists. I was skeptical, but overall, it does a good job. Furthermore, as another review mentioned, the iPod does seem more responsive with this update from what I saw at the store compared to my original 160 GB iPod Classic. Some speculation has been that the older iPod Classics will receive the software update of this new one, but I'm not holding my breath on that.     Overall, the original iPod concept was so good, and that is why the iPod Classic is still a solid choice for a music and media player. It will hold thousands and thousands of songs (up to 30,000 according to Apple at 128 bitrate). I also backup some important files to my iPod Classic, in disk mode, so that I have that additional extra copy of my most vital files. When you have such a large iPod, you can do that. It shouldn't be forgotten either that while the display of the iPod Classic isn't as good as the iPod Touch or iPhone, it is still quite good and you can play music videos, TV shows, and movies purchased on the iTunes Store.    Battery life for this new 120 GB model improved over the 80GB model from last year. Apple now estimates it at 36 hours audio and 6 hours video.     I'd recommend the iPod Classic without hesitation, to those who have more than 8 or 16 GBs of music in their iTunes library and want to carry their entire collection. Furthermore, if you have videos and video podcasts you want to always carry with you, again, you can't beat the storage. I have the lower capacity flash devices as well, but the big hard drive based iPod Classic continues to play an important role in my iPod Collection.",,,,,,
29,ipod_c,1,D. Porter,"Well, I bought two of these. No, don't ask me why. Please just believe that I purchased two new 7th generation iPods - against the advice of the reviewer who obviously did some homework as to why the old units sound better, I might add. I looked at many forums and read from many people who think the new iPods, (6th generation and later,) have a poorer sound quality than their predecessors. Then I read from those folks who believe that yes, Apple changed the audio codec chip, and yes, several audiophiles have done some qualitative testing and the old units won, but nevertheless, the difference should be impossible to hear with the naked ear. Let me just assure you right now, it is not. The difference in sound quality between my wife's 5.5 gen 80 gig iPod and my two new 120 gig units is vast. Using the same headphones and songs, downloaded from the same computer, the new iPod sounds like listening to music played inside a tin can compared to the old one. For instance, in one song a drummer rakes his hand across some chimes and on the 80 gig, the chimes are crystal, distinct, and separate from all the other things going on at the time. On the new 120 gig at the same spot, the highs are all compressed into a jumble of noise with flat, tinny, cut off sounds. The chimes sound far off and suppressed. The list of music defacement goes on. I noticed this problem across all tonal ranges. So what did I do? I opened a case with Apple and made an appointment at the nearby Apple store. Yes, I lugged in my laptop and two of the iPods. At the store I synced one of their units to the same song and we went through all three iPods, my one new unit, my one old unit, and the store unit, listening to the same 30 or so seconds of song on each iPod over and over. And over. The results were clear... much clearer than the sound from the new iPods, I'm sorry to say. At the store I also inquired about the noticeable lag when starting songs on the new unit. I was told, ""It's much more complicated software."" Obviously the ability to view the album covers has won out over quality sound. So I'm returning the two 120 gig iPods. Apple is getting them back. Good riddance. Perhaps Apple has forgotten that people buy iPods for entertainment's sake. Music and movies. I hope this helps them to remember that people buy music playing devices to actually listen to music. Now, I've read from the reviewers who suggest that we who want good sound from portable music devices should just get over it. Well, I say blah! Blah on them all! I assert that Apple should be improving sound with new generations of devices. If they want my money that's what they will have to do. I don't believe it's unreasonable to expect newer models of expensive electronic devices to outperform old ones. As for sound quality, the older iPod puts forth very adequate sound. Certainly it could have been improved upon, or at the very least left alone. In fact, how dare the naysayers suggest that we all settle for poor sound? That we should expect poor sound? I say my money goes to the company willing to aim for high fidelity from its music devices. That won't be Apple for the nonce. If all you want is an expensive portable hard drive with a video screen, this is definitely the unit for you.",,,,,,
30,ipod_c,5,Andrew A. Burnett,"I am a big tech nerd, and although I am a little disappointed that apple will be paying less attention to the classic ipod I bought one, and I really enjoy It!    I previously had a 30GB Video Ipod and It lasted me about 3 years. Its being repaired for a new battery now, but I figured I would upgrade since my library had grown.    Not much has changed to these new ones, except the interface a little. I love genius and I am stoked that it was worked into the functionality. It remains about the same size as my 5th generation? video and so still fits my old rubber case (which is nice).    Probably the best thing about it is, doing a comparison between my roommates 30GB ipod video and this one, I find that the audio quality on this one has improved quite a bit. I don't know if its the connectors or maybe a d-a converter, but it definitely sounds better. I am a recording engineer so I might be a little more apt to hear it, but its cool.    Overall I am stoked about my new ipod. Its a great device! I will be sad to see apple move on to more of a multi-tool type device, but that doesn't sway my review on this one. Enjoy!",,,,,,
31,ipod_c,4,Barrett Benton,"In a number of circles, the iPod Classic is now considered the ""less sexy"" iPod. Largely because of the things it appears to lack vis-a-vis the newest ""fully-wired"" iPods/iPhones: it doesn't have a phone function (d'oh!), it doesn't ""do"" wide-screen for video and games the way an iPhone/iPod Touch does, and...well, it doesn't seem as much *fun*, darn it! (Memo to the only-two-colors-available fashionistas: silver and [charcoal] black, being *classic* colors, go with everything. When's the last time you saw a pink Audi or Merc? Mary Kay doesn't hand either of those out to its top sales stars, which is just as well.) ;-)    Let's rewind a bit (sorry for the tape-based analogy) to a MacWorld seemingly long, long ago.    At the time, people were clamoring for Apple to include video in their next-generation iPods (they had just announced the iPod Photo, which was the very first iPod I ever owned...sometimes, not being an ""early adopter' can pay off). His Steveness replied, more or less, that people value music a lot more than than they value TV/video stuff, so for the time being, no video iPods. While I happened to agree with Jobs' sentiments (I rarely watch the box, so there), I also knew how shrewd a businessman he was, and if the Hoi Polloi wanted video in their iPods, by cracky, he'd make 'em! And while I wouldn't damn him to Hades for such a pragmatic decision (he's doing this stuff to make a buck, okay?), the aesthete in me would be put off just a bit. That was then.    NOW: Through a bit of hard work and happenstance, an iPod Classic (120GB) happened to fall into my lap recently (long story). My beloved 60GB iPod Photo wasn't even half-full, but I welcomed this newest 'Pod with open arms. The reasons?    - Capacity. Let the deniers who bought their iPhones, Touches, and nanos prattle on; if you're a serious music lover, you've got a ton of music on the home front, and, if you're Of A Certain Age, probably in more than one format: CD, LP cassette, and, if you're particularly well-preserved, you might even have a few commercially-produced open-reel tapes lurking about.  Paying upwards of $400 or so for the ""biggest"" iPod Touch might be a bit of a stretch for you...am I right? You might not even give a rat's tuchus (it's okay to say that here, right?) about video and gaming capability, but you'll really care about capacity. Are we grokking here?    Good. Because this iPod, even this late in the game, is aimed toward you and me. Apple, now the 900lb gorilla of the portable digital-media market (how strange that must be to Mssrs Gates & Ballmer) has the market covered: you want a device that's all-singing, all-dancing? You can get an iPhone, or, short of that, an iPod Touch. If it's got to be as tiny as possible (I won't ask why...), there's the nano, or, if it really has to be much smaller, the lovely 2nd-Gen Shuffle (which my Significant Other managed to lose shortly after I presented one to her as a gift; she'll inherit my iPod Photo now).    - True Gapless Playback. The iPod Photo had just one glaring flaw: any album by a group that had a thing for track-into-track segues (say, XTC, the Beatles, Pink Floyd...you get the idea) didn't translate at all with the Photo; you'd get an abrupt track change instead of the smooth, proper transition the band and engineers intended. I know the iPod Generation kicked off the ""rip/mix/burn-it-like-you-wanna"" thing, but if I want to hear the damn album the way it was released, then I should be able to. In the iPod world, this possibility didn't materialize until the 5th Gen iPod (video). Now that I have the newest Classic, I really, really appreciate this.    - The Sound. Most talk about getting good sound from an iPod is almost entirely focused on headphones, usually fairly pricey ones. But, to use a high-end audio mantra, you only get out what you put in. Sometime around the introduction of the first iPod Classic, Apple quietly made some serious engineering changes in the output section of the iPod, resulting in both a reduced noise floor and improved detail. One online review stated that the new design appeared to be ever-so-slightly less ""warm"" sounding than the previous design, but between the lowered noise floor and improved musical detail the new design was a solid net gain. I concur: subjectively, the Classic's overall sound might sound a tad less ""euphonic"" than my iPod Photo, but I also notice better transient detail and handling of low, delicate notes with both my semi-isolating, against-the-ear Sennheiser PMX200 headphones and my Sony MDR-EX85LP in-ear 'phones. Somehow this seems to have at least a slight effect on line output, too: playback through the living-room hi-fi (via a Griffin AirDock, also a screaming bargain at its current price) offers similar, but not quite as obvious improvements over the iPod Photo. This isn't a case of bad versus good: this is good versus Mighty Good.    - The Classic is, as close as can be, a direct descendant of the original iPod that turned the portable digital music-player market on its ear. The enhancements it has picked up since then have made sense insomuch as they haven't gotten much in the way of the Prime Directive, if you will: allowing the user to carry and access her/his music collection about easily, and with reasonable fidelity. No, it was never a direct replacement for a killer home 'fi (which most people don't possess), but more than ear-pleasing in the environs in which these devices are most-often used. (Yes, as a New Yorker, the subway comes to mind most often...particularly the F, A, C, and #2/3 lines.)    - While I do admit that the iPhone/iPod Touch interface is mad-cool and industry-leading, I still believe the Click Wheel more than holds its own in terms of overall ergonomics; as has been pointed out in a few other reviews here, it's still the only interface you can manage one-handed, and which allows you to navigate between music tracks without looking at the unit (why isn't THIS the iPod ""Touch?""). Like the 5G iPod, you get video, which for the most part I couldn't care less about (although I can now view the video portion of my iTunes purchase of The Traveling Wilburys Collection, which is sort of nice). The notion of watching music videos, let alone feature-length movies, on a not-even-three-inch screen, when we're being assaulted with the idea that a 32"" screen at home is woefully inadequate, 'specially if it ain't high-def, is a bit inconsistent.    But, this is about music, music you can take with you.    By this lone standard, the iPod Classic clearly blows everything else Apple offers into the weeds. Anything not made by Apple, IMO, hasn't even found its way to the starting line. The interface is highly functional and sexy enough, without allowing surface to roll straight over substance.    The happy thing is that Apple offers options to fit just about anyone. If you need a single do-it-all device, and don't care (at least at the moment) about capacity for all your fave tracks, you've got either the iPhone 3G or iPod Touch; if you want your device as tiny and unobtrusive as possible, you've got either the Shuffle or the polychromatic nano. And, finally, if, like me, you want, over all else, as much of your music at hand, wherever you are, as your balm, your salve, your relief from waiting-room Hell or airport Purgatory, the Classic is really it. And, for what it's worth, the current (120GB) Classic wil be able to use the newest Apple earbuds with in-line remote control and microphone (they've got a twin-driver 'phone ""coming soon"" that promises to be grand-sounding; we'll see). If you haven't checked out any 'Pods since the Photo or before, this is likely the one to finally pop for.",,,,,,
32,ipod_c,3,Herucles... Doh!,"My 4th Generation photo ipod broke this week and I was forced to purchase the latest 6th generation ipod.     Whilst this new slimmer version looks better, has more capacity and runs longer, there are a few things it doesnt do aswell.    There is some backward technology here that annoys me.     I have over 4000 songs categorically filed in their respsective albums with cover art. Everytime I delve into an artists directory Im annoyed by the (albeit momenatary) load up time of the cover art. It is a small lag, but the delay is frustrating. I hate load up times. And this is something I never had to endure in my 4th Generation ipod. Perhaps it is a software weakness.     And this small minute but gigantically annoying lag also exists everytime I want to skip a track. There is a small but noticable lag between pressing the button and processing the change. Its small... I know... but it wasnt a problem before.     And my biggest gripe is the lack of sturdiness in the ipod itself. It looks flashy but I'm scared its going to break the first time I drop it. ANd I will drop it eventually. The original ipods were wrapped in a layer of thick acrylic. This thing is glasshouse in my overly excited hands.     Ultimately Apple needs to remember that a percentage of its original customer use the ipod for what it was intended. A huge portable collection of music that they wish to access with ease, speed and safety. The bigger screens, the flashy metal and the video capacity comes second. Leave that stuff for the ipod touch.    The ipod classic as it is intended is a step forward but two steps back.   ",,,,,,
33,ipod_c,5,Samuel Chell,"Apple's name for this device is aptly chosen.  It was an ""innovation"" when the iPod was first introduced (my 10 GB is still running and looking great).  Since then the ""upgrades"" to the non-solid state models have been changes reflecting the latest technology--video, color, storage capacity.  It remains the most practical and convenient way for the user to back up, maintain and access a large collection of audio/video files--and my 10 GB was no longer nearly enough.    The negligible price difference (at Amazon) between the 160 GB Classic 6th Generation and the 120 GB Classic 7th Generation makes for a tough decision.  The new Genius feature certainly was not a factor in my thinking (thank goodness Apple didn't go with multiple colors, FM capability, and other largely superficial add-ons to their ""Classic"" line).  But after reading some of the negative consumer reviews on Amazon (perhaps not the best idea) for the previous, 160 GB model, I decided to sacrifice the extra 40 gigs and place my bets on the current model.  I'm not sure that I ""gained"" anything, especially since I have no use for Genius or cover flow (hence, better performance of that feature is irrelevant to me), and I don't watch movies on anything less than a 20"" screen.  But it's true that this model is slightly thinner than Apple's previous largest-capacity model, and it still performs like the winner it always has been.    It's unclear to me why users of a device like this require files much larger than MP3 or AAC compression.  In previewing all of the possible formats in WireTap Studio, including WAV and AIFF, the differences in fidelity between the compressed and non-compressed files are barely discernible to the best ears--even more so when using the Classic with one of the popular iPod speaker systems.  And although I don't expect the iPod to replace my CDs, tapes and LPs, I'm surprised at how close its compressed files come to the original.  Primarily, I regard it as an invaluable index and library.  Unlike the Touch or iPhone, it's user-friendly even to those of us who don't have the patience for ""texting,"" multitasking, reading maps, viewing movies on what are miniature, pocket-sized computers.  The Classic is a different animal--a record library that's practically the equivalent of a Walmart store filled with LPs.    If you still have any misgivings about price and value, consider that the storage capacity of a Macbook Air is 60 GB and 80 GB, and the cost 7 to 10 times that of an iPod Classic, which lacks only the keyboard and internet capability (on the other hand, a Mac Air won't fit in your pocket).",,,,,,
34,ipod_c,5,Alex,"NOTICE: This review is for the NEW 2009 160GB iPod Classic, NOT the 2007 160GB iPod Classic!      The new 160GB iPod Classic is easily Apple Inc.'s best iPod to date, and out of all of the iPods that I own, this is my favorite.      First, the capacity of this iPod is simply unbeatable. I've yet to see another portable media player that can match the iPod Classic in capacity. I have a huge music library, and it's nice to be able to carry every song that I own on my person at all times. What's more, thanks to the iPod Classic's capacity, I also have room to carry a few videos with me, and some of my photos. If you don't like having to pick which songs to load onto your portable media player, the iPod Classic is the way to go.      The second thing that I love about this iPod can be summed up in two words: it works. The 160GB iPod Classic that was introduced in 2007 was extremely buggy, had a non-responsive Clickwheel on many units, crashed frequently, and required a hit-and-miss firmware update to stop the hard drive from spinning even when the device was ""off,"" which often lead to dead batteries. All of these problems left the 2007 160GB iPod Classic warming shelves and earning it the infamous ""honor"" of being the ""worst selling iPod ever,"" according to Apple. I'm pleased to say that the new 160GB iPod Classic released earlier this month has virtually none of these problems. There's no ""spinning hard drive bug,"" the Clickwheel is incredibly responsive, and the device isn't crash-prone. While it's true that many of these issues were fixed with last year's iPod Classic, there hasn't been a truly functional 160GB model until now. To put it bluntly, this is the iPod that Apple should've released in 2007.      Another thing that I really like about this iPod, and the iPod Classic in general, is it's ability to double as an external hard drive. While I believe that the iPod Nano is also capable of this, the only iPod that really has enough space to function as an external hard drive is the iPod Classic. The hard drive functionality admittedly reduces the number of devices I have to carry on me at any given time. If you regularly work with large files and are considering a new iPod, the iPod Classic is the way to go, plain and simple.      So what are the caveats? Well for starters, as with every other iPod Classic, this is a hard-drive (rather than flash-memory) based device. As a result, it has moving parts which make it unsuitable for running or any physical activity that exerts mechanical shock onto the iPod. Unless you exercise constantly with your iPod though, this really shouldn't be an issue. The only other caveat, which is more of personal taste than an actual flaw, that I can find, is that Apple has not made any cosmetic changes to this device since they introduced it in 2007. Now don't get me wrong, the point of an iPod ""Classic,"" is to retain the ""Classic"" design, but after seeing how much better a black Clickwheel looks on the silver iPod Nano, I'd have thought that Apple would have given the silver iPod Classic a black Clickwheel as well. However, I admit that this is entirely my personal preference and not a ""flaw"" per se. I've put a quick list of pros and cons together, which can be seen below:       Pros: Largest iPod Capacity-wise, long battery life, ""Genius"" feature, excellent value for your money, well-built, doubles as an external hard drive, and improvements to Cover Flow.    Cons: Hard Drive (rather than Flash memory) based storage medium; device is cosmetically identical to the 2007 80GB model. (I still don't understand why Apple hasn't colored the Clickwheel black on the silver model to match the iPod Nano.)      Finally, I would highly recommend this product, which is why it gets five stars from me. I don't like the iPod Nano; it's too small for my hands, and the screen is too small for my eyes. While the iPod Touch may have app store access and Wi-Fi, I find it to be a really gimmicky device, that makes for a poor portable media player, (Apple was wise to position it as a handheld game system,) and is really an ""iPhone without a phone."" In contrast, the iPod Classic is an excellent portable media player, it has an excellent interface, and it only costs $249 dollars. To put things in perspective, the 2009 160GB iPod Classic costs $70 dollars more than a 16GB iPod Nano, and $150 dollars less than a 64GB iPod Touch. All in all, I highly recommend this product.",,,,,,
35,ipod_c,4,Juan Fuentes,"This is the second iPod I own. The first one was a 30 Mb 5th Generation Ipod Video.      First, the plus.    There are many improvements in the 7th generation comparing it to the 5th, although I think most of them were introduced with the 6th Gen. The whole Cover Flow/Genius capabilities are definetly an improvement to the previous software. The games are a nice bonus. I've only had it for three days, but I can already see that I like the new interface a lot more.    And the disk space, I mean, WOW! The ipod is basically the same size as my 30 Gb one, but it's capacity is over 5 times bigger. I am an avid music fan, have tons of music, and my musical taste ranges from ambient to heavy metal, but I think it's going to be a long time before I fill this one up. I think this is the best feature of this iPod, and by itself, the reason you should buy it.    There are also video capabilities, which have always been a plus, and some other stuff, but I didn't see a major difference from the previous versions.      But then, why did I give it 4 stars? I wanted 4.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't let me do that.     Here are the cons.    First, as previous reviewers have stated, the sound quality seems to have downgraded from the 5th Gen iPod. The sound lacks depth, the songs sound more flat. I don't mean to say that the sound is bad, because it still has a very good sound, and I've tested it with headphones, computer speakers and my car stereo. I'm just saying that the 5th Generation iPod sounds better, and the difference is quite noticeable.    The other thing, which might be just my iPod, because I didn't see other reviewers mentioning it, is that the click wheel seems to be less sensitive/responsive than the 5th Generation one. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is annoying sometimes that you try so select a song or an option on the menu and the wheel doesn't respond right away.    There's also the fact that using Cover Flow seems to make the iPod proccess slower, but then again, loading the covers of literally thousands of records is not a quick task, and you can always not use Cover Flow, so I won't hold this against the iPod.      To sum it all up. If you have a lot of music and want to carry it all with you; if 30, 60, 80 or 120 Gb is just not enough; if this is your first iPod purchase, or if you just really, really like the new interface and games (I know I did), then I highly reccomend it, and you won't be dissapointed. To me this is definetly the best music player on the market. You will need to sit down and learn how to use iTunes, but when you do, you're just going to love this little gadget.    However, if you have a 5th generation iPod that's working just fine, and you prefer sound quality to disk space, you might not want to buy this one. Just try to be more more picky with the songs you put on it, I guess.    ",,,,,,
36,ipod_c,5,Matthew Mitchell,"I am quite new to the portable mp3 world, although I have about 250 gb of music on my computer.  The only mp3 player I own is a 1 gb Samsung Pebble, which I use at the gym.  This was the only mp3 player I thought I needed since both of the stereos in my vehicles have mp3 disc players.  But then I started thinking...since my new Camry has an auxilary jack to hook up an mp3 device, wouldn't it be great to have one and get rid of those giant cd wallets?!  The first task was to get permission from my wife to spend 250 bucks.  After a little hesitation, she agreed.  And then it was on to the research.  Since I have such a large collection of music, the capacity of the device was number one on my list (as well as positive reviews & quality).  I was pleasantly surprised to see that Apple had reissued the Classic in 160 gb form instead of the 120 gb.  So after much personal debate between the Zune and the new 160 gb iPod Classic, the iPod won out.         Although the iPod is a fantastic little device with a large capacity, the software is not without its troubles.  I downloaded the most current version of iTunes (verison 9) and immediately began importing my mp3 files from my hard drive.  This process can take some time, but not much longer than any other media player.  I was so excited to finally have the majority of my music all on one device; and have the cover art as well (I just think that is awesome)!  After loading a large chunk of my files into iTunes, I noticed that only a handful of the albums had the cover art.  I attempted using the ""get cover art"" function, but it didn't work.  My only option was to track down the cover art online, right click, save, and then add the picture to the album file in iTunes.  I know that it's not such a huge deal, but when you're dealing with A LOT of music, it can become quite a pain & time consuming.  I later learned that the files have to be spelled exactly like they are in iTunes.  And if they didn't come from iTunes in the first place, 9 times out of 10, the album art won't come up anyway.  I would like to see a function that gets the cover art from other online sources, not just iTunes; and without a strict spelling criteria.  There's no reason that the way I name my ""The"" bands should restrict the retrieval of cover art.  An example being ""Animals, The"" instead of ""The Animals.""       So other than the minor annoyance with the cover art, the player itself is fantastic.  I found the interface very user-friendly and intuitive, without much of a learning curve.  Again, I am new to the world of iPod, but I can honestly say that I am very pleased.  I wanted to write a review for people that have a large digital music collection that came mostly from ripping cd's to their computers.  I am one of the people who still enjoy listening to an entire album, and is not satisfied by just downloading the single, so I still buy physical cd's & collect vinyl.  I would definitely recommend the 160 gb iPod to any music fan with a large collection.  Just remember to be patient when getting the artwork for all of those older albums.  If you don't have a collection full of Taylor Swift, the Jonas Brothers, or Beyonce, iTunes just may not recognize your music!",,,,,,
37,ipod_c,2,carolinawren,"I love the iPod but this has been a huge disappointment. The hard drive is really noisy when it changes songs, and it did not remember where it was paused in a couple of audiobooks.  I assumed this was a defective one and got a new one.  Amazon customer service is impeccable!    The second iPod has a less noisy hard drive, but it reset itself for no reason in the middle of a song and then when I tried to re-sync it would not connect to iTunes. Once it finally connected, iTunes says that there is no music on the iPod and that it cannot be synched/recognized. This was after 1 day of use where it was not dropped or mistreated and never left the house.  My 5th generation iPod, 3rd generation and shuffle synchronized just fine, so it's not iTunes or my Mac.      Also, I would say the music quality is not as good as the 5th generation with video.  It lacks depth on the new Classic.  The size of the device and the hard drive capacity is fantastic and I really like the ability to use the genius function.  I even like the slightly odd split screen.  I will probably try again with another one, but this is really disappointing.  My first bad experience with many years of Apple products.",,,,,,
38,ipod_c,1,APM,"One fine day my 160 gb classic iPod stopped showing on iTunes. So I took it to the nearest Apple store hoping to fix the problem. There the iPod ""guru"" looked at it, and after 15 min, came back telling me (quote): ""I have bad news and good news; the bad news is that, despite our efforts, we can't fix your iPod; the good news is that if you want to get a new one, we'll give you 10% today"". WHAAAAT!! I have roughly 300 songs in it only, it has always been sitting in my Bose dock station, save for a couple of walks where I took it with me (no running or any other major movement that could have destabilize the hard drive). I am really disappointed. I though Apple would stand behind their products. I have a 7 year old 40 gb iPod that I gave to my daughter, and, regretfully, it works MUCH better than the modern iPods. I will probably get another iPod, since my entire music library is in Apple format and I like the look and accessories of Apple products. However, I am not expecting it to last long. Another disposable electronic product. This time, coming from Apple instead of Microsoft...Sad, sad, sad...",,,,,,
39,ipod_c,1,Music Lover,"When I bought my first iPod classic just over 2 years ago, I was absolutely enthralled at the amazing capacity and versatility of this product.  Being a music lover and collector, it was a dream come true to be able to carry almost my entire music collection with me.  My first iPod classic was a silver 80GB.  I was so impressed that three months later, I bought my husband a black 80GB to take with him when he travels on business.  The silver 80GB lasted just over a year.  One day I was playing it and went to fast forward to the next track and poof - the screen went black and I was not able to reboot or reset it at all.  Since it was no longer under warranty, I stuck it in a drawer and used the other black 80 GB that I had bought for my husband.  Approximately three months later, the black iPod classic died exactly the same way (and conveniently no longer under warranty).  So, I went and purchased two more, this time a black 120GB and silver 120GB.  My son uses the black one, and as far as I know is still working.  In August, I purchased the silver 120GB.  Within 1 month, this one died the same was as my first two.  I took this one to the Apple Store in a mall near my home and they swapped it for a new one.  Two months later, the warranty replacement iPod died.  Once again, I took it to the nearby Apple Store for yet another replacement.  This time, the technician who helped me kept making comments and innuendos alleging that I was abusing the iPod.  The way I use my iPod is what I would consider normal use.  I have a Bose dock that I sometimes play it on.  I also have an Alpine AM/FM car audio receiver made for iPod.  I also have a mini dock with speakers that I keep at work.  The Apple store technician made a comment to me suggesting that perhaps I shouldn't be using the iPod this way.  Now the second replacement iPod I got in November died just a week ago (lasted about 2 months).  For me, that was it with iPods.  If Apple manufactures this product to play music with, then it should be compatible with all the docks out there.  I think that Apple has a very lucrative racket going on with the iPod consumer.  You spend an average of $230 for an iPod and it lasts maybe just over one year.  If the battery goes or the iPod dies, you are not able to change the battery yourself to make it work again.  If you have Apple do the repairs, it costs almost as much as just buying a new one.  So, then what do you do?  You go buy another new iPod.  The concept is wonderful, but the product quality and durability is shabby and inexcusable.  I could go on about how you can't play tracks you buy from iTunes on anything but the iPod, but many other starry eyed consumers such as me have learned the hard way.  I think that eventually, the public's love affair with the iPod will eventually wear off and unless Apple remedies their quality and reliability problems with the iPod, Apple has a hard fall coming.  You can't keep ripping people off this way, Apple, and expect them to keep coming back.",,,,,,
40,ipod_c,1,torrid_wind&#8482;,"This was my first purchase of an Apple product. Although, I originally was introduced to computing on a Mac (and I LOVED it), Microsoft's domination of business computer sales and software kept me from ever purchasing a Mac. I was unwilling to exist in a less than parallel software universe.    When I purchased my first MP3 player in 2005, the best reviews I read were for a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3N78Y"">Creative Zen Sleek 20 GB MP3 Player</a> (even though, iPods were the best selling MP3 players on the market). I got five years use out of that product. It occasionally crashed and had to be rebooted, but was otherwise user friendly and trouble-free. After five years of use, my Zen Sleek got crash happy and needed replacing.    Not long ago, Consumer Reports rated the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F7AHY6"">Apple iPod classic 160 GB Silver (7th Generation) NEWEST MODEL</a> the highest for the things I care about the most (performance, durability and ease of use). So, I purchased it (last week).    The design of this iPod is as slick as hell. The thing allowed me to import album cover art from hundreds of albums at the click of a button. It's half as thick and weighs only half of what my previous MP3 did, but the hard drive is eight times larger on this new player. Very cool.    This was the end of the fairy tale.    Problems began almost immediately. Though, I was able to load my entire 40+GB collection of MP3s onto the unit in minutes, my playlists were each missing between one and 193 tracks! I read the directions carefully, consulted the Q&A Help section and eventually spoke with an Apple Technical Support representative for assistance. His advice helped me to delete ""shell"" duplicate tracks, but this didn't help my playlists load with any improvement. I have no idea if any part of the problem was due to my (brand new) Windows 7 Home Premium operating system. If the Technical Support Representative was aware of reports of trouble from Windows 7 users, he didn't mention it. Needless to say, I was exasperated after six days of this trouble-shooting. I returned the player to Amazon. I intend to order the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267A7QC"">Cowon S9 32 GB Video MP3 Player with Touchscreen (Titanium Black)</a> upon receiving a refund for the iPod.    I can't figure out why these things are so popular. The desktop program is great. The portable device is maddening!  The instructions walk you through what they call ""Syncing your music library"". What they should call it is ""Selective Syncing"", because that what the thing does.     My Creative Zen Sleek player did syncing the old fashioned way: flawlessly. I never had a single problem with it. It didn't reorganize my music library on the player. It copied my music library precisely as I have it organized (folders by genre, sub-folders by artist, sub-folders of albums (containing every song on the album).    The Apple iPods apparently work seamlessly for millions of people. So, I don't want to bash this product. I wish I could have gotten assistance figuring out precisely what the problem was. I didn't, so it had to go.    Unfortunately, I'm only able to rate this product with one star. :-(",,,,,,
41,ipod_n,4,Steve H,"The iPod Nano update on September 1, 2010 is arguably the most dramatic since the iPod Nano moniker was introduced by Apple five years ago.     Several colors are being offered in both 8 GB & 16 GB capacities.      More than an update, this is a new product that simply retains the iPod Nano name. It gains a significant feature, but loses several others.     The big deal is the touch interface on the newest iPod Nano. iPod Nano users will now be ""touching,"" their music as iPod Touch and iPhone users have before them. The click wheel is gone. To find your music, you select a category from the Nano's menu such as ""Playlists,"" or ""Artists,"" and select from there. Less convenient or more convenient than a click wheel? Honestly, about equal. The screen is indeed small, but not unusable.     FM Radio has been retained as well as the Fitness aspects with the ability to use Nike + or simply the built in pedometer. However, the form factor will be a major benefit for those working out with the Nano. The previous Nano required an armband to keep it on you while working out, jogging, or the like. Not always comfortable, an additional expense, etc. However, with this new small, square form factor that need is gone. Now, we can simply ""clip,"" the Nano onto us, with the built in clip, and run to our listening content. A bigger deal than you might think.     The downside? Features have been removed from Nano. The screen is much smaller than the previous generation. Therefore, playback of video content from iTunes is gone. Nano no longer plays video, which was a feature added three years ago. Secondly, last year, Nano added a small video camera to record low quality video, which could be played back on the Nano's screen or synced with iTunes and viewed on your computer. That feature is gone too. The device is too small now for a camera or to watch video. This new generation iPod Nano has many exciting new features, but buyers must be aware that it is no longer a video player. It is something new. Those wishing to play video on an iPod must choose an iPod Touch.     My opinion on this change? Honestly, did I ever watch video on the iPod Nano's screen? No. For me, while they kept trying to make the screen larger, it was simply too small to enjoy more than a once a year video. Likewise, the camera was simply not high enough quality to keep yourself entertained by using on a regular basis. It became a feature unused by many.     The iPod Nano has changed and gone back to being an exceptional music player. There is nothing here you do not need to enjoy music. However, the display and touch interface brings the 21st century ""touch,"" that Apple has made so popular to a more affordable device. The touch function will be limited here to simply selecting songs or bringing up the clock, but nevertheless, touch has made its way to the Nano.     I'm most thankful that the Nano has indeed retained the DOCK CONNECTOR. The dock connector is key to use with iPod accessories such as docks, speaker docks, and built in car iPod connectors. The nano is so diminutive that if you plug it into the factory iPod kit of an automobile, the cable's dock connector will look nearly bigger than the Nano itself. Not a negative, just amusing. Nevertheless, the dock connector is there, and you will be able to use the device in such applications, and that was a significant decision by Apple. Users want and need the dock connector. It is there on this iPod Nano, but still missing from the Shuffle due to its even more diminutive size.     This 16 GB version is the largest size Apple offers in the Nano. It offers no additional functionality over the 8GB, but features twice the storage. Choose the one best for you. 16 GB is great if you have a large music collection. We should all remember though that with Nano no longer doing Video or Storing Pictures, the storage is exclusively for music. This makes 8 GB and 16 GB more appropriate size offerings as music takes up much less storage than video.     Overall, Apple has removed video (both playback and recording) from this iPod Nano. However, it's an equalling good music player. Navigation of music is now completed via touch, which works effectively despite the small screen. It's really hard to believe so much can fit into such a small device and I believe everyone will be a bit shocked when they open up the Nano the first time and see it's size yet primary function as an effective music player retained. The newest Nano brings a nearly Shuffle like size, but yet retains the functionality (touch, clip, dock connector) that serious music lovers and those who use the Nano while working out, demand.",,,,,,
42,ipod_n,3,Your Role Model,"But it's not a Nano. Once you get that, the rest is easy. It's also a bit of a mixed bag.    **UPDATE**     Apple apparently has heard the complaints, and has released a Version 1.1 Software Update that    1) Now allows users to turn the Nano COMPLETELY OFF by holding down the Wake/Sleep button for several seconds.    2) Allows users to use the Wake/Sleep button as a 'Next Song' button by double-clicking it (this is the new default setting; but you can change it so double-clicking Plays/Pauses instead, or you can turn off double-click functionality altogether. The default also allows you to advance to your next radio station preset via double-click). This change may also improve the Nano's battery life from awful to 'meh', as you won't have to use the power-gobbling touchscreen to advance to the next song/radio preset.    Due to these improvements, I am provisionally upping my review rating of the Nano to three stars (batt life and pricing/value-for-money remain issues). End update. ***    A lot of ppl are confused about the radical re-invention of the Nano, not realizing that the Nano is, essentially, dead. The Nano's mission was to be a compact iPod that still did some higher-end stuff such as video and picture-taking- a nice portable 'media' player. No more.    The new Nano, aka Super Shuffle, is focused on a different task entirely, and much the same one as the regular Shuffle- the gym. To that end, Apple radically reduced the size and gave it an integrated clip a la the regular Shuffle. It is now 'wearable', and is basically the Shuffle with a screen that many have wanted for a long time.    The downside is that many others loved the 'true' Nano, and now they can't have one, unless they go running for the old 5th gen models before they're gone. So the Super Shuffle will be disliked by some no matter what, as it 'killed' the player they loved. =[    Others will say the Super Shuffle is inadequate even for the gym. ""I don't want to look at a screen to switch songs or change the volume. Lame!"", they'll say.     To be fair though, you don't HAVE to look at the screen, because    - The Super Shuffle has physical volume buttons. They're small, but still easy to use. And as of Software Update 1.1, you can now double-click the Wake/Sleep button to advance to the next song- a useful improvement.   - It has the 'Shake To Shuffle' feature... literally shake it to shuffle to another song. But StS, as implemented, is inconvenient to use- see notes @end of review.  - It supports VoiceOver. But to use *all* VO features requires the Apple Earphones With Remote & Mic, which are NOT included (Apple either wants another $30, or they still haven't solved the sweat/moisture issues those 'phones have had in the past).    So, some quibbles aside, the 6G Nano works fine in its role as a 'gym' Shuffle with a screen.    Features-wise, it does photo-viewing (but not taking), audiobooks, podcasts (minus any video), voice memos (w/the optional 'phones w/Remote & Mic), is a pedometer, and does FM radio besides. And radio stations do sound surprisingly clear in any halfway decent reception area. Even low-power college stations usually come in cleanly- a definite plus, since they often have more innovative music programming than commercial FM.    The Nano also retains the 30-pin dock connector, so you have access to the universe of iPod accessories (for some examples, check out 'iPod Nano 6G Docking Options' on YouTube). This is all well and good.    So MY BEEF with it isn't that it killed the 'true' Nano (if there's enough demand, Apple will bring 'em back), but rather the level of 'milking it' Apple's gone with here. Specifically, while I own and (almost) like it, the Super Shuffle just isn't worth an additional $100-130 MORE than a regular Shuffle.     They do much the same thing, after all- the additional features are pretty minor in nature (for example, ever try to get consistent FM reception inside a large concrete building, aka your typical gym? Best be near a window.)    Sure, you do get the touchscreen, which is sharp/clear, fun to use, and eerily resistant to smudges & fingerprints (nice). But said touchscreen is also *really* small (going bigger would've sacrificed 'wearability') and sucks WAY too much battery juice (see notes @end of review).    And yes, you do get 6GB more storage than the Shuffle (though that cost Apple about $10 to put in there). But a 'gym' Shuffle doesn't really have to hold 2,000 songs (4,000 if you opt for the 16GB), nor does the tiny screen lend itself well to navving through all that. The capacity and price points are really Nano legacies, but as we know, this ain't a Nano.    All in all, the advantages just don't add up to the price charged, in terms of value provided. You can buy THREE regular Shuffles for the same money.    Apple likely should've offered a 4GB model for $99 to $129. Hitting that price point next time would be a good goal, as that's about what a 'Super Shuffle' is really worth.     Here's hoping we see that, *and* a new 'true' Nano once the 7th gen rolls around. Yes, a Shuffle with a screen is COOL- just not cool enough to justify shelling out $150-180, as I discovered.    I do want to dig ya, Super Shuffle, but the price/value-for-money equation is your Kryptonite. =    Also, and significantly, the battery life is very 'touchy' (see Notes below) and pretty disappointing, and there are a few minor bugs & interface issues (also see below).    UPDATE: Got bit by a bug (on 1.0 Software): My Nano would endlessly loop the same song over and over. A Restore to Factory Settings fixed it, but still, strange.  _________________    Note #1 (Colors): If you buy online, be aware that the casing colors are paler/more muted than they appear in pics. The blue Nano, for example, is a smoky, very pale blue in person. The exception is the Product Red model (which is Apple Store-only): it's a VERY vivid red in real life. But the other, more understated colors are nice enough, and arguably more 'grown up'.    Note #2 (Battery Life): The batt life on the 6G Nano is HIGHLY dependent on how much you use the touchscreen. Playing around with it a lot- which is EXACTLY what you'll do when you first get one- just KILLS the batt juice. No way around it: the touchscreen, while fun, is also a huge battery hog. =[    The screen sleep behavior compounds the problem, by keeping the screen lit far too long after a touch. This *isn't* changeable in Settings either. WTH?     Thus, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND putting the screen to sleep MANUALLY via the Wake/Sleep button EVERY time you're done touchscreening- don't let the screen turn itself off, it's VERY SLOW to do so. Your battery life will thank you.    Btw, Apple's claimed 'UP TO 24 hours of battery life' appears to refer to just playing music, with no screen usage. But for REAL-WORLD use, that figure is a fantasy, since you obviously DO have to use the screen for some things. Also, playing around lots with the (touchscreen) radio tuner to find that 'perfect' station is just pure battery kryptonite (Tip: Set up your radio presets early. Turn off Live Pause too- some report batt life issues with it).    For myself, doing 90-minute workouts with a mix of radio/regular music, I take 25% off the battery on average - so, about 6 hrs of battery life, real-world. The 1.1 Software Update may improve this some, as it should reduce screen usage. Be aware that the Battery Life icon is quite inconsistent- 1st usage after a charge may read as taking nearly NOTHING off the battery, while a similar but later use can read as taking HALF the battery. Bottom line: Yes, you'll be recharging frequently. Reducing the Screen Brightness can help slightly.    Note #3 (Bugs, Interface issues): i.e. 'Things I hope Apple fixes in a Software Update, if they're listening'.    - In low-but-usable radio signal areas, you'll get lots of erroneous 'No Radio Signal- Please plug in headphones' messages. I get these WITH my headphones plugged in, listening to a station that's coming in a bit quietly but just fine. =[    - MANY ppl blamed the poor battery life of the Nano on the fact that you couldn't manually turn it completely OFF (it would Sleep instead). This has been fixed with the 1.1 Software Update, but, the bad news: it's the TOUCHSCREEN that's the true batt life culprit. =[    - If you set the text to 'White on Black' in Accessibility (which improves contrast/looks cool), all touchscreen icons & wallpapers get turned into weird photo negatives of themselves. Whaaa?    - The Battery Life icon and Time should be visible on ALL screens (such as 'Now Playing'). Having to nav back, or 'hold down to jump to Home screen' is annoying/slow and wastes power.    - As previously mentioned, the backlight power-saving needs work.    - The 'Shake To Shuffle' feature needs some rethinking. First off, it's iffy 'til you figure out the technique-  2 short, FAST shakes in any direction, *with the screen ON* (1 can work, but the % is lower).     Many gym ppl/runners don't like this though. They wish StS worked with the screen OFF, so they can reach over and shake w/out having to do a no-look Wake/Sleep button jab. Apple's worried about accidental triggerings, but you'd like to see a better solution than this.      But a big 'thank you' to Apple for the improvements made in the 1.1 Software Update. Here's hoping more Nano-love is upcoming, such as ANYTHING more than can be done to save power/improve the battery life  =    Note #4 (Protecting Your Hearing): Volume Limit in Settings is your friend. Correct procedure: Set up your max volume limit with it while in a QUIET room. At the gym, noisy treadmills/equipment/etc can make you crank your volume to the point of causing permanent hearing damage- not a happy outcome. Volume Limit is a hearing-saver. Use it.",,,,,,
43,ipod_n,4,Bob Penn,"With the announcement of the new Apple TV, and now the release of the drastically revised iPod Nano, it would appear that Apple is in the process of re-evaluating its product line and re-tooling the entries to match what it perceives to be the needs of the consumer.    With the Apple TV, they have correctly, I believe, simplified the complexity of the original offering, removed any notion of storage, which tended to confuse the average user, and prepared it for an app driven iOS future. They claimed these changes resulted from a close look at the usage of the current Apple TV, and that they made the changes they felt were needed to more closely match what was desired.    The Nano, I believe, follows the same path.    I have an iPhone and and the new Nano. I also have the previous generation Nano. I tend to agree with Apple: I never the older Nano once to watch a video. I never used the contacts, the calendar, nor did I play a game on the Nano. I bought it for jogging, I only used it for jogging.    All those things removed from the new Nano I currently do on my iPhone. These removed features were worthless to me and will not be missed.     But the Nano did do exactly what I wanted it to do: become smaller, and be easier to use. Though I am getting used to a virtual pause button vs. a physical button on the older model, I find the new Nano to sound a little better and is less intrusive during running.    Apple has apparently moved away from the ""same feature set, different design"" view and has moved to ""what's best for the intended useage?"" model. They now have a mature line of music players, each with a clear and intended purpose.    The Classic is for those who wish to carry their entire music collection with them.    The Touch is the top of the line universal player and application machine. Not intended for exercise, but rather for those who don't have an iPhone but want its best features.    The iPhone, a Touch with a phone built in. Same positioning as the Touch, but replaces your phone if you are in the market for a phone.    The Shuffle: the low cost entry point into the Apple ecosystem. Probably the only way Apple could offer any product under $100. With its small storage, and lack of screen, it appears to be essentially a gateway device for some to enter the Apple world.    And finally the Nano. Not the universal player anymore. Not the smaller iPod Classic, like its predecessors were. The Nano seems to be targeted to the highly mobile exercise crowd. The Nano is really only good for playing music, which, along with the Shuffle, make it the only ""pure"" iPod left. If you want a music player, and you want more than 2GB or storage, but you don't need apps or video or games because all you want to do is listen to music, than the Nano seems ideal. It fails when we try to make it something is clearly not intended to be. And for those who grieve at the loss of the features, I am sure Apple's answer is that ""you really want a Touch."" They're right, too. The days of the Nano needing to be a stripped down Touch or Classic vanished the day the Touch was released.    So, though not perfect, I think the design and intended use of the Nano fits in nicely into the Apple music player offerings.",,,,,,
44,ipod_n,1,M. Chapman,"Bought this for the Nike + feature...liked the idea of a music player built into a system to track my runs. The Nike + part of this unit worked great, easy to understand and easy to use....in fact I like it so much I am going back to my old mp3 player (creative product) and getting the nike sportsband so I can keep using the Nike + features. However I have sent back two different ipod nano units due to serious problems with the music component of this device.    1) This unit does not have a way to completely shut it off...only a sleep wake button. If you do not make absolutely sure that all music is stopped, the radio is off, this thing drains battery life very quickly because you cannot fully shut the unit off.    2) The headphone jack is not very secure...using the ipod's headphones and another set of headphones from a different mp3 player the cord came out easily, when the cord was jostled sound would cut in and out making listening to the music annoying. Also becuase the radio antenna is the headphones it was constantly losing radio reception or unable to locate stations.    3) Volume control seems like it would be easy with buttons on the side..however on the units I tried the volume would lock itself to either no sound at all or set so loud I could only keep one port in one ear. I like to be able to adjust volume as I am running or working out based on the song, the environment, etc...not very happy with how difficult it was to deal with the volume.    4) When I could get radio reception and made sure not to jostle the cord (sitting down outside) the unti shut itself off after 60 seconds unless I kept hitting icons on the unit. It didn't do this when I was playing from my songlists...just in the radio mode.    5) When you want to shuffle a song while running...you have to wake the unit up then either figure out where on the screen to tap (without getting your sweaty fingers all over the unit and without tripping as you look at the screen) or shake until hopefully the device realizes you are trying to change songs (I was not very impressed with the shake to shuffle feature).    6)This device does not come with a manual...you have to go to the apple page to get the manual and download it. Customer service was useless. THank goodness for Amazon's amazing return procedures!",,,,,,
45,ipod_n,3,Peter Hunt,"In a way, I understand what Apple are trying to do with the latest nano - get back to basics.    In the last couple of years, they've added features to the nano which weren't really improvements, just additions. The nano's main purpose as a take-anywhere music player was muddied by other features that didn't really fit. The screen was not really big enough to watch TV shows or movies on it. The video camera was simply not hi-res enough to be competitive or useful. As I've said in other reviews, it seemed that these features were added not because they made the nano a better product, but just because Apple could add them.    With the latest nano, Apple has stripped away all those extra features, and gone back to trying to make a best-in-class take-anywhere music player. Great idea. Unfortunately, they failed in two respects - the execution of that idea, and the price.    The two main design changes in this nano are the smaller screen, and the replacement of the click wheel with a touchscreen (with buttons for volume). Both of these changes make the product less successful as an on-the-go music player than previous models.    Having a smaller screen makes it harder to find songs - only a few lines can be displayed at a time. On a purely aesthetic note, having the mix of icons and menus in the user interface is more cumbersome and less clean that the purely menu-based UI of previous models. Not a big deal, but Apple's appeal has traditionally been their sense of aesthetics.    Removing the click wheel is a serious misstep. The click wheel made it easy to adjust the volume, scan back and forth within a track, or move between tracks in a playlist or album *without taking the player out of your pocket*. You didn't have to look at the player; just dip your hand into a pocket, quickly find the click wheel by feel, and make the adjustment. You can't do that with the new nano. While superficially cool, the touch screen makes the new nano harder to use than its predecessors.    Finally, the price. Apple is charging the same price as the previous model nano, for the same amount of storage. In essence, we lose the extraneous features in order to pay for the touch screen. I would accept that trade-off if the touch screen better served the nano's core function as a portable music player. But it does not.    I'm giving the new nano three stars because, despite being a step down from previous models, it's still a pretty good music player.    But in paring down the nano back to its primary function, Apple also made design changes that make it perform that function less well, and then charged us for them. Far from being an improvement, the new nano is a disappointment.  ",,,,,,
46,ipod_n,4,Steve H,"The iPod Nano update on September 1, 2010 is arguably the most dramatic since the iPod Nano moniker was introduced by Apple five years ago.     More than an update, this is a new product that simply retains the iPod Nano name. It gains a significant feature, but loses several others.     The big deal is the touch interface on the newest iPod Nano. iPod Nano users will now be ""touching,"" their music as iPod Touch and iPhone users have before them. The click wheel is gone. To find your music, you select a category from the Nano's menu such as ""Playlists,"" or ""Artists,"" and select from there. Less convenient or more convenient than a click wheel? Honestly, about equal. The screen is indeed small, but not unusable.     FM Radio has been retained as well as the Fitness aspects with the ability to use Nike + or simply the built in pedometer. However, the form factor will be a major benefit for those working out with the Nano. The previous Nano required an armband to keep it on you while working out, jogging, or the like. Not always comfortable, an additional expense, etc. However, with this new small, square form factor that need is gone. Now, we can simply ""clip,"" the Nano onto us, with the built in clip, and run to our listening content. A bigger deal than you might think.     The downside? Features have been removed from Nano. The screen is much smaller than the previous generation. Therefore, playback of video content from iTunes is gone. Nano no longer plays video, which was a feature added three years ago. Secondly, last year, Nano added a small video camera to record low quality video, which could be played back on the Nano's screen or synced with iTunes and viewed on your computer. That feature is gone too. The device is too small now for a camera or to watch video. This new generation iPod Nano has many exciting new features, but buyers must be aware that it is no longer a video player. It is something new. Those wishing to play video on an iPod must choose an iPod Touch.     My opinion on this change? Honestly, did I ever watch video on the iPod Nano's screen? No. For me, while they kept trying to make the screen larger, it was simply too small to enjoy more than a once a year video. Likewise, the camera was simply not high enough quality to keep yourself entertained by using on a regular basis. It became a feature unused by many.     The iPod Nano has changed and gone back to being an exceptional music player. There is nothing here you do not need to enjoy music. However, the display and touch interface brings the 21st century ""touch,"" that Apple has made so popular to a more affordable device. The touch function will be limited here to simply selecting songs or bringing up the clock, but nevertheless, touch has made its way to the Nano.     I'm most thankful that the Nano has indeed retained the DOCK CONNECTOR. The dock connector is key to use with iPod accessories such as docks, speaker docks, and built in car iPod connectors. The nano is so diminutive that if you plug it into the factory iPod kit of an automobile, the cable's dock connector will look nearly bigger than the Nano itself. Not a negative, just amusing. Nevertheless, the dock connector is there, and you will be able to use the device in such applications, and that was a significant decision by Apple. Users want and need the dock connector. It is there on this iPod Nano, but still missing from the Shuffle due to its even more diminutive size.     This 16 GB version is the largest size Apple offers in the Nano.  It offers no additional functionality over the 8GB, but features twice the storage.  Choose the one best for you.  16 GB is great if you have a large music collection.  We should all remember though that with Nano no longer doing Video or Storing Pictures, the storage is exclusively for music.  This makes 8 GB and 16 GB more appropriate size offerings as music takes up much less storage than video.    Overall, Apple has removed video (both playback and recording) from this iPod Nano. However, it's an equalling good music player. Navigation of music is now completed via touch, which works effectively despite the small screen. It's really hard to believe so much can fit into such a small device and I believe everyone will be a bit shocked when they open up the Nano the first time and see it's size yet primary function as an effective music player retained. The newest Nano brings a nearly Shuffle like size, but yet retains the functionality (touch, clip, dock connector) that serious music lovers and those who use the Nano while working out, demand.",,,,,,
47,ipod_n,1,P. Wright,"I could not be more disappointed in this Nano 6th generation model.  I have the Nano 5th generation and the only thing missing was a clip.  That is what lured me into ordering this 6th generation, the clip.  Now that I have it, I am sorry I bought it.  All the good Nano features are gone.  The size is too small.  The tiny touch screen does not work well for me at all. I don't know why they couldn't keep the familiar Nano style and features and add a clip. There is also no lock like the former Nano models.  I would not recommend this 6th generation to anyone.  I don't know how they even have the nerve to call this a Nano. Buy a 5th generation and you won't go wrong.",,,,,,

49,ipod_n,1,kevin corbi,"I have been a fan of ipods since the 07-08 nano came out and then when they released the 3rd generation Ipod touch. I thought I was hooked until I got one of these. I liked the 4th and 5th gen ipod nano- great screen, good controls, camera with video was great along with coverflow for music and seeing the list of songs by an artist. I went wrong with this and returned it just as I did my 3rd gen Ipod touch. Apple seems to release some great looking ipods without very good quality. My ipod nano was too small on the screen to see more then a couple songs by the same artist and on top of that, they stripped off features that I really liked on older generations of nano. This is basically a stripped version of nano that isnt really a nano, but a shuffle in disguise. I really liked apple at first, but after this and a lemon of an ipod touch, which had a list of its own problems- they were both returned and I will not be buying anything anytime soon. I would much rather wait until apple figures its junk out, and gets itself back into making interesting and useful products. I will be looking forward to hopefully seeing video and camera on the nano once they have perfected this new design, and the same with the ipod touch, but for now- I am on hiatus from apple products as I felt like these new lines are leaving much to be desired in many ways. If you want to just listen to music and not see what is playing or going to play next fine- but having a screen that is far too small and all the good features taken away this device is NOT in any worth the 150- 180$ they want for a roided up version of the shuffle. Like many other people say, if you dont care about anything but playing music and not seeing much info about anything, then this is fine, but there are other mp3 players now that will eventually give apple a run for their money.",,,,,,
50,Seagate,5,S. Devarakonda,"UPDATES IN THE LAST PARA    I have clarified a few things that other reviews had issues with and gave it a low rating.    For Starters: Since I use Both Mac & PC, I can 1000% say that it works on both these operating systems.    Some customers had issues with the drive going into sleep mode after 10 mins or so. Well, the copying process does not stop, just because the drive has gone into SLEEP mode.    You can take this SLEEP feature off by:    Process 1: Downloading a Free Seagate Manager program available on the Seagate website.  (I did not do this, I used process 2, described next)    OR    Process 2: Formatting the drive and remove the pre-installed Seagate software. Then the drive will NOT go to SLEEP Mode.    How to Format a Drive in Windows:   Plug the Drive --> Go to My Computer --> Right click on the Seagate icon--> Click ""Format""     How to Format a Drive in Mac 10.4 or earlier:   Open Macintosh HD --> Click Applications --> Click Utilities --> Open ""Disk Utility"" --> Select the Seagate disk listed on the Left Side --> Click ""Erase"" tab --> Choose Volume Format to ""MS-DOS"" (I chose this so that I can use it on Windows & Mac).     (For the newer MAC 10.6.1 or later, I guess Format is : ""Mac OS Extended (journaled)"", as rightly pointed out to me by a learned customer IB...Thanks dude!)    Design: Compact & Sleek. Little bigger than the iPhone, but lighter than the iPhone (8GB)    Connection: NO A/C Power outlet needed. Only single USB port is needed, everything provided in the box. So you just take it out and plug it and use it.     Compatibility: Both PC & Mac. Although on the box it says ""FOR PC"", it was detected by my MAC and will work with both.    Size: Though it says 500GB, we get 465.35GB. And this is the case with most hard drives.    Speed: Forget about the specifics - it is FAST!!    Well worth your money, right!!!    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Many customers have asking me why the format process did not work for their Mac?    The reason is, I have a Mac version 10.4.1 and I clarified that in the review.I guess there are a few changes for 10.6.1 and I added that too. If your MAC OS does not fit the description, the best way to start is by finding out OS version of your MAC & then search online on how to format it OR take it to an apple store.     Basically, the STEPS on how to format remain the SAME. But you might find some different Volumes Format based on your OS version. Volume Format will change as new Operating Systems (OS) keep sprouting.     When I bought this drive, there was not a single review which spoke about MAC Compatibility, let alone the other issues. But I took the risk and bought it for $100 or so.     Also, if you compare other reviews vs. mine. My review does not speak about how many songs I have on my drive, who gifted me this, how my life has changed with the new drive, how my office folks like it, how it fits in my pocket although the it is a trouser from my high school.     No offense, they are good individually. What I mean is....one review answer about plug n play....another spoke about light weight (by how much they didnt say)...another complained SLEEP issue...But none answered MAC compatibility, Format, Weight etc    My review has even answered everything that can happen with this drive. (Except that ""What will happen if it breaks down"" :P )    ",,,,,,

52,Seagate,3,Jeffrey Peterman,"I bought this drive for three reasons:  1. Large capacity in a small form factor,  2. The ability to power/access it from a single USB port,  3. It was on sale at Amazon for under $70.    I started using it on my laptop when it arrived yesterday and was impressed: small, and it worked well with the short standard mini-USB cable. Then last night I plugged it in to my desktop and went to transfer over my 400 GB movie directory. It kept failing after about 10 seconds, at which time Windows 7 would report that I had just attached it. My first thought was it was due to the ""sleep"" utility, so I downloaded and installed the Free Agent tool from Seagate and set the timeout to Never. Didn't make any difference. I then used the test tool in the utility software and the it reported a drive failure at about 8%, and said I should contact Seagate for an RMA. All my other small external drives (except for an ancient 30 GB) need a splitter USB cable: one end connects to the drive and the two other ends connect to the PC, using the extra USB port for power. As I had nothing to loose, I gave one of those cables a try - it works fine. So, it appears that the drive needs more power than my PC can provide on a single USB cable.    I'm tempted to send it back, but I'm off on vacation tomorrow and it is a perfect drive for that. I may contact Seagate when I get back - maybe my drive is bad?      - - - - Update - - -   It worked perfectly on my trip, and it was nice to have the space. I've now tried this drive on four PCs - my desktop, my father's desktop, and two laptops. It works fine with the single cable on all but my desktop. This is strange, as I've tried the on-board USB ports and the ports on two add-in cards (one as USB-2 with four ports, and the other a USB-3 with two ports) and the drive will only work if I use a USB splitter cable. So, I have to say that the experience I reported in this review is unusual, and I can understand why others report it works fine with the single cable.",,,,,,
53,Nikon,5,Michael Allebach,"For the cost of this camera, I don't think you can get anything better.  The low light performance is off the charts. As a wedding photographer I regularly shoot with Nikon's high end professional equipment and I was amazed how close this camera is to a pro camera.   Now let me get specific.  In order to compare I took a look at 100% files out of each camera I own.    Which camera excels Nikon D3100($Cheap) VS. D300($1600) VS. D700 ($2,700):  * Lens = The D3100 is the only camera that comes with a lens at it's normal price  * ISO Performance = Tie between D3100 and D700! (It could be Nikon's new processing but the JPEG looks fantastic I was shooting D3100 on 6400iso with very little noise at all)  * Low Light Focusing = D700  * Focus Speed = D700  * External Buttons & Controls for Pros = D700  * Menu Navigation = D3100   * Ease of Use = D3100  * Megapixel = D3100 (14.2)  * Sensor size = D700 (Much more important than megapixels but I won't get into this)  * Can use older lenses with functionality = D700 & D300  * Video = D3100 of course! 1080P video looks amazing.  * Frame Rate = D300 at 6 photos a second  * Weight = D3100 (light as a feather)  * Ergonomics = D700 (big enough for all my finger)    Lens:  The lens is a kit lens, it will work outside but not so great in low light. The Vibration Reduction will help indoors but Vibration Reduction can't stop a child or pet in motion indoors. Consider buying a 35mm 1.8dx AFS for around $200 and you will be super happy with this camera.    Video:  I purchased the 3100 specifically to shoot video, so I put on Nikon's brand new 85mm 1.4g Nano lens and shot video with it.  The lens costs more than double the camera but I wanted to see how the 1080P video looked.  It has the look of a cinematic movie. After the 85mm, I put on Nikon's 50 1.2 manual focus lens and was able to take very cinematic video in manual mode.  In order to make it brighter or darker you either need to use a really old lens like the 50mm 1.2 and hit the AE-L (auto exposure lock) and twist the aperture to change exposure.  Or you can hit the AE-L button when you get the exposure you like.  Its not a perfect system but it works well for me.  Inside the menu options you can change the AE-L button to hold the setting until you reset which is helpful.    Jello Cam (What's not so great):  This camera still suffers from the ""Jello Cam"" look in video if it is not on a tripod and you are shaky.  The video can look like jello if moved too quickly.  Use a monopod or tripod when shooting to avoid this.  I'm not sure if a faster video frame rate 60fps would help - but at 24 and 30 it can suffer badly.    Conclusion:  This is an amazing deal!  Unless you make most of your income from photography or have a stockpile of old lenses (this camera can only autofocus with AFS lenses) then this camera is the must have camera of the year.  If you have good composition skills and an eye for light you can take photos worthy of a magazine with this. Seriously, you won't regret buying this camera.  When you do, do yourself a favor and buy an additional Nikon AFS lens that has a maximum aperture of 2.8, 1.8 or 1.4.  These lenses will take better portraits and deal better in low light than the kit lens.  ",,,,,,
54,Nikon,5,J. Douglas,"I recently updated my DSLR collection to the Nikon D3100 from the Nikon D70. There are good reviews out there that you should check out. However, I would like to share some of my first impressions.    Pro:  -Better image quality and lower noise at high ISO with the D3100  -MUCH MUCH lighter, which will be nice when traveling  -Larger LCD screen  -11 focus points, including 3D focus which tracks the motion of the subject or camera.  -1080p Video  -14 megapixels  -2nd Generation DSLR  -Quiet, quiet, quiet    Cons:  -No bracketing option. Not a huge deal since I only bracket once a year  -Cannot use my old 50mm 1.8 lens. I knew this before purchasing the camera.  -As of 10/1/2010, Camera RAW for the D3100 is not supported in Photoshop or Lightroom. Need to shoot .jpg + RAW or use Nikon Capture NX2 for RAW files. That should be updated soon, so not a big deal.  -Can hear the lens focusing when recording video.  -No depth of field preview.  -Can't use wireless remote    I'm an amateur photographer and this camera meets my needs. I love the fact that it's small and light, with great quality images. If I were a serious photographer and had more money to spare, I would wait and check out the D7000, which appears to have phenomenal specs. I'm happy with my purchase and I highly recommend this camera.",,,,,,
55,Nikon,5,VIPUL D KAPADIA,"Hurray! The long wait is over! Nikon had us wait for such a long time for its newer models (D3100 and D7000) and it was just when we started thinking if Nikon will ever have an answer, anytime soon, to Canon's T2i, 7D and 60D) they released these two wonderful cameras - D3100 and D7000. Let's focus on D3100, shall we?     So I finally had a chance to get hold of this D-SLR at Best Buy today. I am not a pro by any means but I have used many different D-SLRs including Canon (40D, T2i, XSi) and Nikon (D90, D5000). When I picked-up the camera for the first time, my initial reaction was, ""whoa - this is so small and light weight""! It wasn't that I wasn't aware of the specs - I knew them beforehand but I was still blown away by how small and light it felt when I held it in my hands. Then, I thought, the grip would not be very comfortable but I was wrong as holding and operating the camera is just fine - thanks to Nikon's well-thought-out design and grip. For the size and feel, it's very similar to D3000 but has more goodies from the higher versions. So from an initial wow factor, I quickly moved on to focusing on features and capabilities.     I have just started using this camera so more update will follow but in the meantime my initial assessment of this camera is - I am impressed! It is one heck of a camera which can certainly compete against the best in its class (Canon T1i, T2i, Nikon D5000). Check out detailed reviews at dpreview (.com) and cameralabs (.com) - they should be added soon if not already there.     I love this camera because it:   + has enough mega pixels for my needs (14.2).   + captures crystal clear images (thanks to EXPEED2 processor & the CMOS sensor, the sensor is slightly smaller than the one used in D7000).   + offers 1080p (HD) recording, AF subject tracking is awesome (10 min max is fine with me; it records outstanding videos even in low light and to me that's big).   + offers ISO from 100-3200 (D90 starts at 200), it can go higher but I really don't think why I would need anything above that.   + is small & light weight yet has good grip, easy to carry around in hands or neck.   + supports SDXC cards on top of SD and SDHC - now that's nice.   + (25-Sep-2010): has buttons that are well organized especially the video recording mode with a lever so you cannot mistakenly activate recording. That video recording lever once unlocked, gets locked in 30 seconds if you do not record and the countdown begins as soon as you unlock the lever. Also you can record video while you're in any dial (imaging) mode (Auto, P, A, S, M, and so on) where as in Canon T2i, etc. you have to move the camera dial to movie mode. So this is a great convenience - you can jump between taking pictures and recording videos with a simple unlocking of the lever. Additionally, you can be in a preferred dial (imaging) mode (Auto, P, A, S, M, and so on) and change the release mode to Single, Continuous, Self-timer or Quiet mode (this is located right underneath the main dial) - another great convenient feature.  + (04-Oct-2010): In-body photo and movie retouch menu.  This is great as we don't need any special software to apply certain touches.  I love it.    Could have been even better if:   - it had the bracketing option (not too much to expect at this price point level but oh well I don't use that much but for some people this could be a big plus).   - grid lines were available (I miss them in both in live view and in the view finder).   - Active D Lighting was not limited to just ON or OFF (either you have it or not at all, instead of low, medium, high, etc.). Don't get me wrong the ON just worked fine (better than Canon T2i) but I can't compare with all other modes.     Recommendations (optional accessories):   * In my personal order of importance - your preference may differ. *  1.",Nikon UC-E4 USB Cable - not included. (~$6)  2.,UV filter - a must for protecting your lens against accidental damage. (~10$)  3.,"Carrying case is a must to protect your investment.  There are many cases to choose from and it's up to you to decide but I suggest getting something like Lowepro SlingShot 102 AW (all weather proof carrying case) so if it rains, you can pull out the weather guard and cover it up. ($90)  4.",Additional rechargeable Lithium Ion EN-EL14 battery so you never run out the juice when you're traveling and do not want to miss capturing a moment for good.  (~$35)  5.,SB-600 Speedlight.  Those who have used speed lights would know what difference it can make to an image with adjustments you can make to light for an image. (~$225)  6.,"18-55 VR lens has its limitations so if you have extra $$$s, buy body only (if that even is an option) and get yourself a 18-105 VR lens. But at that point, you may want to consider D90 which still is a good camera and offers many more controls. (~$325 to $350)    Overall:   I give this camera 5 Stars because it takes excellent pictures in almost all conditions (bright or low-light) and that is exactly what I wanted this camera to do for me. Period.     I must commend Nikon for not getting into the mega pixel race (read marketing). They instead kept the photographer in mind and focused on delivering greater picture quality. Kudos to Nikon for having that courage.      "
56,Nikon,5,Macauley,"This Nikon D3100 is a phenomenal deal for non professionals, the rest of us people that want to take family and travel shots. I've owned DSLRs since 2004, starting with a Nikon D70 and then moving to D40, D200 and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012YA85A"">Canon Digital Rebel XSi 12.2 MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Black)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5P90K"">Canon EOS 40D 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)</a>. Those are all excellent cameras, but this Nikon D3100 is better than all of those in one crucial area, the area that matters: it takes excellent pictures without having to fiddle with the settings between shots. Yes, the other cameras are better in other respects: They have more buttons to change settings without delving into menus, they are bigger (is that a plus?), heavier (another plus?), and have better specs (1/500 flash sync speed for D70 and D40), but in the end I would have to fiddle with the settings to get the best results: change the white balance, fiddle with the ISO (my Canons would default to ISO 400 for flash shots, why? Who knows. That meant disabling auto ISO and choosing ISO settings manually), the exposure (+0.7 indoor, 0 outdoor), and so on. D200 was noisy at higher ISO, D70's pictures tended to be cool (i.e. not warm), 40D had cool custom buttons (C1, C2, C3, very cool), but I found its ergonomics worse than XSi or any Nikon; why place the on/off switch at the bottom of the body? Who knows. Fortunately, new Canons have fixed this).    This D3100 also makes the D3000 and D5000 obsolete. The D3000 is slow and noisy at high ISO. The D5000 only shoots 720p (not 1080p), no autofocus in movie mode, less resolution. Old technology.    What sets the D3100 apart from all the other cameras above is this: set the camera in P (program) mode, auto white balance, -0.3 exposure compensation, slow flash sync mode (for people shots), auto distortion correction on (great!), auto chromatic aberrations correction on (great!), and you are set; now you can concentrate on the only aspect of photography that matters: composition, i.e. framing your shot in the best possible way. There must be a photography mantra that says, ""thou shalt buy the D3100, and the D3100 will set you free."" Now this is if you shot jpeg. If you shoot raw, you can then use a program like DXO, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0JKSS"">Aperture 3</a>, or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003739DVY"">Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3</a> to further play with the pictures. My workflow with the XSi was to shoot raw, then use DXO to batch process all the pics according to two settings: people (low contrast, no saturation added) and landscape (contrast, saturation, etc.). DXO would then batch-remove lens distortion, chromatic aberrations, vignetting, apply custom curves, change white balance when necessary, and apply its (almost magical) auto lighting settings to make the shots pop. For now DXO does not have a custom module for the D3100 (still too new of a camera), so I'm shooting jpeg for now. Once DXO adds the module for the D3100, I'll takes shots in both raw and jpeg fine and compare the jpegs straight out of the camera with the raw images processed with DXO. I'm curious to see the comparison.    This is great, not only for you, but also for your non-photographer spouse; my XSi took phenomenal shots, but I had to know how to set it. Can you imagine me going to my non-photographer wife and say, ""okay, when you take indoor shots of our kids, set the camera on A mode (Canons expose for ambient light in A mode and adjust flash for fill, that's great), +0.7 exposure compensation, ISO 400 or 800, white balance on cloudy, and shoot."" My wife was lost at ""okay."" Sure the custom modes on the 40D would have helped, but the 40D is old technology; can it take 1080p video? I didn't think so. Plus, what lens are you going to use with the 40D? The 17-55 IS? Great lens, but who wants to spend $1,000 for a non-weather sealed 17-55 dust collector (google Canon 17-55 and dust)? Will 17-55 be enough for your telephoto shots? Your kids' baseball games? Didn't think so. What about the Canon 18-200? Sub-par quality, noisy, overpriced.    Back to the D3100. Auto white balance (the second most important thing after composition) works great, even indoor (no cloudy setting necessary), the only changes are extreme situations (outdoor shade, or indoor fluorescent or tungsten lights at night, but that is true with every camera. Why that is is beyond me; can't they make smarter cameras that account for these situations as well?); movie mode is excellent; yes, the mic is mono, but that's okay for family use (and that's why you buy this camera; if you are pro, you landed on the wrong page); if you really want to push it, you can use this camera for video, your iphone/ipod touch for audio with an app like FourTrack, and then sync video and audio in post with the excellent Singular Software Dual Eyes program. Your choice. Matter is: DSLR video can look awesome if used the right way, but keep in mind its limitations: jerky camera horizontal panning will give you  the infamous jello effect (courtesy of the CMOS sensor), so pan slowly. You'll also have to play with autofocus vs manual focus settings sometimes; I've used the camera in autofocus; it has worked great so far.    What lens(es) should you use with the D3100. You should sell the (excellent) 18-55 that ships with the camera. Quality is good, but not enough reach. You can sell it for $140 or so. Take the money and use it toward a more useful lens. What lens? The target market for this camera is moms and dads that want to take shots of their kids; even advanced amateurs like me don't want to travel with a camera bag full of primes and heavy zoom lenses that you have to swap every 10 minutes; this is 2010 (almost 2011), for crying out loud; choose a single zoom and enjoy life and photography; I would use the excellent but underrated <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6W8K"">Nikon 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 AF-S DX VR ED Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras</a>, the excellent (but expensive) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013A1XDE"">Nikon 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX ED VR Nikkor Wide-Angle Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon DSLR Cameras</a>, or my choice, the jack-of-all trades, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JCSV8A"">Nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S ED VR II Nikkor Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon DX-Format Digital SLR Cameras</a>. Yes, yes, if you check sites like Photozone, they will tell you that the optical quality of the 18-200 is not as good (or consistent) as the 18-105 or the 16-85, but it's good enough for moms and dads bitten by the photography bug. A great shot of your kid at 200mm is better than no shot with either of the other two lenses. The optical superiority of the 16-85 disappears at 135mm or 200mm, simply because it can't do it. The 16-85 and the 18-200 are about the same price. The 18-200 will set you free. It won't help you if your kids play baseball at night (too slow), but you'll have to live with it, unless you are willing to drop $2,000 on a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JCSV8U"">Nikon 70-200mm f/2.8G ED VR II AF-S Nikkor Zoom Lens For Nikon Digital SLR Cameras</a>. Sure, we'd all like a 16-300 VR VIII lens with a 20-stop VR reduction, constant 1.4 aperture, with optical perfection, weighing only 500 gr. and below $1,000, but alas our engineers are not as good as the random mutation and natural selection that gave us our eyes ;-0    My settings:  Display mode: detailed photo info > check RGB histogram and data > Done (why? You want to check if you are clipping the red, green, or blue channels)  Transition effects: OFF  Set picture control: portrait (for people shots)  Landscape: for, well, landscape shots: increase sharpness to 4 (D3100 shots are unsharpened by default)  Image quality: raw + jpeg fine (or jpeg fine, if you don't want to mess with raw)  White balance: auto (I played with the settings to A1, A2, A3, but images were to yellowish for my taste, as if my kids had jaundice). Auto works fine  Auto ISO: on  Min shutter speed: 1/30 (1/15 if you have steady hands)  Max ISO: I set 800, you can push to 1600 or even 3200 (your choice)  Standard ISO: 100  Active D-Lighting: on (it works well)  Auto distortion control: on (Great)  Movie settings: 1080 24p. You can also do 720 at 30p for less jerky movements  Info display format: i prefer classic black (your choice)  Auto info display: off  Image comment: your choice. I have my name, copyright (haha), and phone number  Beep: off (please)  AEL-AFL button: I only lock exposure, not focus.    My accessories:  67-to-77 ring adapter (if you have the 18-105 lens)  72-to-77 ring adapter (if you have the 18-200 lens)  77mm haze filter. I use the best, The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BZLBQ"">B+W 77mm UVA (Ultra Violet) Haze MRC Filter #010</a> one. You don't want to use a cheap fIlter on top of a $350 or $650 lens.  77mm circular polarizer fliter; again I use the best, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BZLAC"">B + W 77mm Kaesemann Circular Polarizer Coated Glass Filter</a>. This filter is for your travel shots. It will make blue skies bluer and will remove reflections from that gorgeous Maui ocean. This is an expensive filter at $180 or so; you don't have to get it right away, unless you are going to Maui soon.    Why 77mm filters? Because you don't want to go nuts buying filters of different sizes for your lenses. If buy the 67mm filter for your 18-105 lens and later decide to upgrade your lens to the 72mm 18-200, you are screwed. It's cheaper to buy a $5 lens ring adapter to 77mm and use 77mm filters. It'll keep you sane too.     Remember why you purchase this camera: you want to enjoy photography; enjoy it then.  ",,,,,,
57,Nikon,3,Bruce,"I bought the D3100 about a month ago after my D70 died. I write for magazines and have to include both product and outdoors photos with my articles.    Plus: The D3100 is easier to use on a tripod than the D70 because all the info is displayed on the rear LCD, not on the top of the camera where I can't see it when the tripod is set high. The light weight and small size are major plus factors for the way I work. Controls are very easy to use and quit intuitive. The NEF and fine JPG combo is nice. I suppose the live view is a plus for some people. Photo quality, when the settings are correct, was excellent. Much nicer than my D70 when using the same lens.     Minus: No remote, no grid lines, no bracketing, no Speedlight remote command mode for my 800 flash. Auto focus did not work with my 6 year-old 70~300 non-VR lens (but it works fine with my first generation 18~200 VR).    BIG minus: Nikon has a firmware problem. If I am in Program mode and if the ISO Auto to ""On"", in dim light conditions it uses high ISO whether or not the flash is used. The auto ISO setting does not recognize the flash. Ken Rockwell pointed this out. You have to manually set the ISO when you use flash. If you use the built-in flash for fill-flash, this ISO thing will be a real issue, just as it is when the flash is your mains source of light.     I don't care about the video capabilities, but the auto focus certainly does mess up the video's audio.    In all, I think it's a good camera with that one serious ISO/flash flaw.     ",,,,,,
58,Nikon,3,kgvenky,"I recently purchased Nikon D3100 to replace my Nikon D60.  I did research for more than a month going through all the reviews in the Internet. Generally, review on this Camera is good. I purchased this Camera for its Full HD Video capability, Live View and SD-XC (up to 64 GB) memory card compatibility.    I am not a professional photographer, but have passion to photography, So, I bought this entry level D-SLR camera for better quality image than POINT-AND-SHOOT camera.  I have read lot of books on D-SLR settings like ISO, F-Number, Aperture, Exposure compensation etc, in actual shooting; I end up using AUTO mode.    THE PROBLEM WITH NIKON D3100 (I use with NIKON SB-600 External Flash Unit)  In AUTO mode, Nikon D3100 selects only  ""AUTO ISO SENSITIVITY""     WITH FLASH UNIT:  In indoor shooting; it selects very high ISO Sensitivity (mostly ISO 3200). So the image quality is not good.  In the same condition Nikon D60, selects ISO value of 200, whereas, Nikon D3100 selects ISO 3200. I mean, the Nikon D3100 is not considering the Flash Unit and is not adjusting the ISO accordingly.    WITHOUT FLASH IN CLOUDY MORNING TIME: Even in outdoor daylight shooting, Nikon D3100 uses wide variety of ISO sensitivity (100 to 1600) whereas D60 used between ISO 100 to 400, in the same lighting condition. The image quality of the D3100 is not good in AUTO mode and it is only comparable to any POINT-AND-SHOOT camera.    You can check this in dpreview site; in D3100 (in pg 14 of review) photo of the reviewer taken with built-in flash has ISO 3200, whereas for D60 (in pg 21 of review)photo of the reviewer taken with built-in flash has ISO 100. In the review they have not mentioned about this, but for curiosity, I downloaded the images and checked the EXIF information.    Even the reviewer in dpreview.com has not noticed this biggest flaw!!! It's actually a casual shot with built-in flash, the end result is grainy ISO 3200 picture.    Also, try with PASM mode, by setting SOME max ISO value. In flash mode with Auto ISO, it sets this MAX ISO. The only option we have with camera is setting ourselves an ISO value. D3100 selects high ISO values in AUTO ISO setting and the resulting in high grain pictures, which prevents you to use this entry level D-SLR for Casual photography.    I am just back from 15 days vacation, with more than 1500 pictures taken, out of which 90% taken in AUTO mode. only 3 pictures are in ISO 100. All other in ISO 400 to 1100 in daylight, and ISO - 1100 to 3200 in flash mode.    If you are owner of D3100, please check / review your own photos.     Nikon D3100 has biggest flaw in Auto ISO logic, which prevents you to use this entry level D-SLR for Casual photography. Also Live View and Video is not meeting expectations. My D60 is much better than D3100. I am going to sell D3100 and retain my D60. (If Nikon can fix this in firmware, I like to retain D3100, I have written to Nikon, awaiting reply)    If you want to buy an entry level D-SLR Camera to use like POINT-AND-SHOOT, Nikon D3100 is NOT the ONE.    (Nikon D3100 may produce excellent images with Pro Modes like P,S,A & M, but certainly not in AUTO mode)    Comments added on JAN 31 2011.    I explored more on this D3100 Camera. Now I am using Aperture priority in most Outdoor situations and Changing ISO values to get desired Shutter Speed. I try to keep ISO at 100, if light is not sufficient then I Change ISO to 200 or 400+, to avoid slow shutter speed. It works fine produces excellent results.      ",,,,,,

60,wd,1,AMS,"These WD Hard drives with ""WD Smartware"" are a huge pain. They have an extra very small partition that acts like a Virtual CD drive. When you plug the hard drive into your computer, WD smartware software runs. It can be very annoying and sometimes can cause problems. For example, It won't work with you PS3 until you get the WD Smartware off. The problem is WD meant for this extra partition to be permanent. They created a way for you to ""disable"" the software, but the partition is still there, and it still won't work with your PS3. So, I spent a good 4 or 5 hours trying to format this thing to get rid of the extra partition. It was difficult. The normal windows disk utility couldn't do it (I couldn't get it to work on my Mac either), so i had to download and try a few different disk formatting utilities. That was after spending hours doing what the WD website recommended. Eventually I got it cleaned up and it does work on my PlayStation. I'm really disappointed in Western Digital for trying to force this on their customers without out a simple way to get rid of it.      Final verdict: If you don't mind installing the WD Smartware on every computer you want to use the hard drive on, and don't plan to use this with a PS3, then this hard drive is probably fine. The WD Smartware offers some okay stuff like password protection. BUT, if you want a normal external hard drive that acts just like a thumb drive with no surprises, get something else and make sure it does not have ""WD Smartware"" on it.",,,,,,
61,sony,5,T. Pinsonneault,"I'm usually a digital SLR user, but I've been waiting for a camera like this to come out so I have something to put in my pocket. The features that really made me decide to buy this camera were:    1. AVCHD 1080i FULL QUALITY video. Check the bitrate -- it's the same as the camcorders. Better than the flip or handheld 'HD' bitrates  2. Wide Picture Stitching. I am astounded by the quality of these pictures. Dumbfounded. Check out the ones I've posted.  3. GPS Tagging. Yep- been waiting for this since iPhoto introduced the feature into its software.  4. Low-light performance. For a point-and-shoot, you're not going to beat this. Sure, it's no DSLR, but it's pretty great for the price.  5. Price- a zillion features and a totally reasonable price!!!    Mac Compatibility:  I tried out the camera with iMovie, and it worked seamlessly!!! I imported 2 minutes of low-light video footage AVCHD in about 30 seconds from an SDHC Class-6 card. Also used the camera with iPhoto and Aperture, and everything worked great.    Update: I've had time to play around with the different settings -- you can see some of my results in the customer uploaded images. The panoramas today came out great! I am still awed by this feature (amazon's tiny photos don't do it justice). Shooting inside in the MOMA was excellent. Outside, I tried the HDR mode, with limited success (still need to experiment, but see what I got). The handheld twilight mode does what it is supposed to, impressively.",,,,,,
62,sony,5,C. Pak,"I'm comparing this camera to my most recent camera: Canon SD1000 and Sony TX1.  I'm just a casual photographer.  The most surprising thing about this camera is the weight. If you've owned some high end Sony or Canon PowerShot cameras then holding this camera doesn't ""feel"" normal, it's way too light for it's size...but that's a good thing....sort of.  They achieve this weight reduction by using plastic for many of the body parts (the SD1000 and TX1 are mostly, if not all metal).  The back is definitely plastic, I'm not quite sure about the front.  The mode dial (although very welcome) feels cheap.    That's about it for the bad news. The good news is the GPS locks FAST out of the box and the picture quality is very good, on par with 10-12 mega-pixel cameras. The Sony ""extra"" features such as panorama and 1080 HD video work as advertised and add value to the Sony versus the only current competitor (with GPS and a mega-zoom) the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7 which has not been released yet.  You can compare images between the two cameras on the Imaging Resource site as well as some others.    I'm was going to purchase both this camera and the Panasonic to see which one I liked better, however I'm going to be keeping the Sony. I'm very happy with the ease of use, picture quality and the Sony extra features (such as panorama).    For a case, I'm using the Case Logic TBC302. It fits the camera perfectly with barely enough room in the front pocket to hold a spare battery.  The Case Logic TBC303 is much larger but not too useful, for example you can't put the battery charger with the camera.  It could hold some credit cards or papers, though.    Update: Software  I usually never install the included software because it's so bloated or just not very good to use.  However, the Sony PMB (which is on a CDROM or on the internal camera memory when plugged into your computer) is VERY good.  Good in that it's not bloated and it just works.  You can do everything you expect such as organize and edit your photos or even update/assign GPS data.  Also you can download updated GPS data (which helps the camera lock to GPS faster).  I would dare say the software is nicer than Picasa or iPhoto due to the speed and built in GPS features.  Some other things you can do but I have not tried yet: you can burn a video DVD (either a normal DVD or a AVCHD DVD with 1080i quality, but you need a PS3 or compatible player to watch those).    Update: GPS  I'm happy to report the GPS function works very well. I took a drive while snapping pictures as a test and then examined the recorded locations. The location was being actively updated because it was able to differentiate my position between shots taken seconds apart going about 40 MPH.  Very pleased.    Update: Picture Quality  On closer inspection, the picture quality is a bit soft..I wish I could have the camera automatically adjust the sharpening inside the camera (make it more sharp) but this is not a big deal as the PMB software has easy edit controls.  You can also manually unsharp after you take the photograph. The low light performance is remarkable, especially the low-light modes that actively combine multiple images (hand-held twilight and back-light HDR modes do this). As long as you're steady and you're not shooting a moving subject you can get some pretty remarkable, low-noise images at night.    Other final comment: when you turn the camera off, there is a slight delay (fraction of a second) before the lens retracts.  Not really an issue but just something I'm not used to with my previous cameras and something I just noticed as I'm usually taking quick impromptu photos, on..photo...off.  The interface, although totally functional, is not as ""refined"" as on my Sony TX1 (with touch screen), the LCD resolution is noticeably lower but, again, totally functional.    The mode dial is still bugging me, I feel it's the first thing on this camera that will go...But only time will tell.    ",,,,,,
63,sony,3,Rick in Virginia,"I have been looking for a new P&S for a while and compared the Sony hx5v v. Canon sx210is v. Panasonic zs3 (as a prelude to the zs7). The most important consideration was image quality - followed closely by convenience, a well defined menu system, lens quality, fit and finish and pocketability. The Sony and Panny both had a gps function which was not important to me.     The panny zs3 had poor low light performance and no manual controls. Several bona fide review sites stated that the IQ for the zs7 was inferior to the zs3 so I quickly made a decision that the zs7 was not in contention.     For a comparison between the Sony and Canon I spent lunchtime on a couple of days walking around town - taking only photos with the Sony on the trip out...and with the Canon on the walk back to my office. With the same drill in the evening to compare low light performance. I accumulated several hundred photos. When taking the photos I would use whatever mode or camera setting was appropriate at the time. Specifically, I did not set the cameras on Auto and just shoot in that mode. I also took a fair amount of video. A couple of days later I loaded all photos and video onto my computer and began viewing and this is where the Sony fell down. The images were very soft. At a small size they looked fine - in fact they looked very good. However, with any magnification, the in-camera noise removal processing was evident and very heavy handed. Other review sites stated this, but I had to see it for myself, and even at ISO 125 (the lowest Sony allows) the images were soft. At pixel peeping levels it was very bad. Details were lost and it all looked like plastic. And if the details aren't there, no amount of work in PS or LR will bring them back to life. The evidence of noise at magnification was low, but I'd rather have native noise and remove it with Neat Image than be stuck with an over processed image. Also, there is no manual mode at all...all auto function. There is no iris for f-stop control, so to limit light Sony has chosen to use a neutral density filter and you get only 2 f-stops. Therefore, you get one depth of field for all images. That is almost anti-camera to me.     Sony claims their CMOS sensor is superior to a CCD sensor. That is apparent in the ability to shoot full resolution images for 10 fps bursts, as well as the hand held twilight and anti blur modes. But, to my eye, I don't see any low light benefit of the CMOS over the CCD and image quality did not compare well, though I don't think that had much to do with the sensor as much as Sony's noise algorithm.    The white balance is inconsistent indoors. You can get a custom WB by shooting a white object, but the native AWB will leave you disappointed. Outdoors the colors are warm - no problem there. And it is easy to use anti blur mode to get a quick snapshot anytime and have a good result.    I did not give the video an adequate review since the stills were so disappointing. However, the microphones are situated in the exact wrong location. It is difficult to keep from covering one or both of them as you are filming. It is a very poor design. The flash is weak and poorly located - it is easy to block with your fingers. The light from the flash falls visibly off-centered in the image.    The Sony has some great technology. The 10 fps burst is great, the hand held twilight and anti blur are clever and practical. The menu system is well designed and intuitive. It is a good point and shoot camera for someone that wants only that without the need for printing beyond 4x6 or only for casual viewing on the computer.     The Sony was returned and the Canon sx210is won out. Far better image quality, it has a manual mode with up to 15 second exposure, very good HD video at 720p and good sound, superior low light performance, better flash power as well as being able to adjust the eV +/- for flash photography, better color gamut, the 14x optical on the Canon is nice - some vignetting at 14x, but that is fixable in post process. I do wish the Canon had a faster burst mode.",,,,,,
64,sony,5,John R. St John,"I was interested in both the TX7 and the HX5V because of the HDR and low-light features.  I couldn't make up my mind from the specs alone so I bought both, with the intent of giving one of them to my son as a graduation present.     I have separately reviewed the TX7, and there I give my take on these two features, which are identical for the two cameras.  In this review I'll just focus on the differences between the two.  There are three major ones:  size, interface, and zoom range.     Curiously, despite the vastly different lens design, I could see no difference in the optical performance.  You can check this out yourself by visiting [...] and taking a look at the full-size samples of the HX5V and the TX5 (the TX7 has not been yet reviewed as I write this, but the lens is the same as that on the TX5).  Both are at the top of the compact class , especially at higher ISOs.     As to size, the HX5V appears bulky next to the slim TX7.  The real difference is in the thickness.  It's quite noticeable when the cameras are sitting side-by-side.  The HX5V is heavier, but in actual use this isn't very noticeable.  Both cameras fit easily into your pants pocket.  The TX7 will also fit into your shirt pocket.     Interestingly, I found that the HX5V's greater thickness is an asset while shooting.  It feels more comfortable in the hands.   I hold the camera in my left hand with the thumb and index finger.  When shooting with the TX7 it's very easy for my left middle finger to drift over the lens, ruining the shot if I'm not paying attention to the screen (easy to do in bright sunlight).  Not so for the HX5V, since the protruding lens in the shooting mode prevents this.     In my TX7 review I say how much I like the touchscreen in that camera.  The HX5V has the traditional button navigation.  I much prefer the touchscreen.  It's a lot quicker.  However, the navigation on the HX5V is definitely better than on my previous compact, a Canon SD700IS.  Also, as with the TX7, the text and icons are clean and very readable, even with my poor eyesight.     The TX7 has a 920MP screen, while the HX5V's screen has only 230MP.  You'd think there would be a noticeable difference between the two, but even looking at them side-by-side I don't see much of any.     Another difference is the shutter release.  In the HX5V it's a round button, which is much better than the tiny thin bar on the TX7.  However, the button is located next to the control wheel, which is also round.  In fact, the wheel is on the right, where you'd normally expect to find the shutter release.  I found myself pressing on this a few times, vainly trying to take a shot.     It's the zoom where the HX5V really shines.  The 25mm-250mm range is a great range (though with Samsung's HZ35W and HZ30W you get a whopping 24mm-360mm).  What's more, the HX5V's resolution is sharp at all focal lengths.  My SD700IS is a little soft at its maximum.       To really test the HX5V at its maximum 250mm focal length I compared it to my DSLR (a Canon 20D, circa 2004) with a Canon 300mm EF 4.0 L lens.  The L-series Canon lenses are the white-bodied lenses you see professional sports photographers using.  They are top-of-the-line.  Many years ago  I foolishly spent nearly $1000 to buy a used one on e-Bay.   It's very, very sharp.     I took shots with both cameras mounted on a tripod, using the self-timer to minimize shake.  Compared to the Canon combo the HX5V looked like a rowboat sitting next to a battleship.  In taking the shots I adjusted the camera-to-target position to account for the different focal lengths (the effective focal length of the 300mm lens with the 20D's sensor is huge) so that the image in the viewfinder or on the screen was roughly the same.  The target was a box of fertilizer, with lots of fine print.  Both cameras were set to their lowest ISO settings.     On the monitor they looked the same, even at large magnifications, but the proof is in the printing.  So I first made a moderately cropped 8x10 print of the image produced by each camera (the uncropped prints would have been about 11x14).  I could see no difference between the two.  I then did severely cropped 8x10s, where the uncropped prints would have been roughly 16x20.  Again, no difference.     I kept at it, making prints at huge magnifications.  I was feeling like the guy in Antonioni's Blow Up.  I made 8x10s of a tiny portion of the image, where the uncropped print would be a giant 32x40--essentially a poster.  At this level the HX5V showed some haloing around the details, but the sharpness was the same.     I was amazed by this.  I would have bet money that at some point the Canon combo would have been sharper, but the facts are the facts.     Which leads me to give some advice.  If you're reading this review you've probably already settled on a compact camera, but if you're considering a DSLR I think you should stick with the compact.  I wouldn't have said this a few years ago.  I've had a couple of film compacts over my life, but rarely used them because the quality was not as good as the bigger camera.  That's not true anymore.  Yes, a DSLR has certain advantages over a compact, but to me they pale next to the one fundamental truism in photography: a camera in your pocket is worth a lot more than a camera sitting at home on the shelf.  We should all get into the habit of slipping a little camera like the HX5V or the TX7 into our pocket or purse each day, just like a wallet or car keys.     So, which camera am I going to keep?  I'm embarrassed to say that I can't seem to part with either.  I guess I'll get my son something else for graduation.",,,,,,
65,sony,5,Mark Crandell,"This has loads of useful features and takes good looking photos.  GPS + compass lets you see where you were and what direction you were pointing when taking photos. Works with the supplied photo browser software and others like Picasa 3. Only problem with GPS is that after you power on the camera some of you photos will be tagged with the previous location while the GPS tries to update the location. GPS can be as quick as 15 seconds, but depends on cloud coverage, the number of surrounding buildings, etc.    Some of the other features I've found useful after only a few days.  HDR mode - combines 2 back-to-back images and merges them giving you more dynamic range in the photo.  Anti blur mode - merges 6 shots into 1 to help eliminate motion blur.  Panorama stitch - great for cityscape/scenery. (Only works on the wide angle lens, no zooming allowed)  25mm lens - great for indoor shots with lots of people.  Face detection - easy to focus on people, smile detector makes capturing good shots automatic and helps when trying to take self portraits.  1080i AVCHD capture. (Yes, you can zoom while taking video)  SDHC/SD/Memory stick compatible, takes either of those memory cards.(Finally Sony!!)    As far as the camera body goes, it is pocket-able. The lens does stick out a bit, too bad they couldn't have made it flush with the body.  Stereo microphone, unfortunately the placement of the microphone may be problematic if you hold the camera with 2 hands, holding with one hand is no problem.  Flash is tiny, and I've covered it up a few times.    For next generation of this product, I would hope they improve the GPS feature, make it quicker, give more feedback about the last GPS position that was locked and how old the location data is. Also the screen is hard to see at an angle, so trying to take shots above you head is difficult.    I don't have many gripes so far. I'm liking this camera  ",,,,,,
66,sony,5,D. Pierce,"I've had the HX5V since I replaced my Canon SD800IS in March, '10 and have been very pleased with what it has to offer. It captures great images but with a caveat. It is not, strictly, a point and shoot. It has features such as the hand-held twilight, anti motion blur and iPanorama that take some knowledge and practice to make the most of. Most of the complaints I have read here relate to a misunderstanding of the camera features and not a failure in design. I'll address some of the the issues and how I have avoided or dealt with them.    Colors: Most compact digital cameras come with auto-ISO and auto white-balance as the defaults. I always over-ride the auto-ISO with the lowest ISO setting and adjust manually from there if needed. Auto WB is left on, but virtually no current camera will decipher the odd mix of light that compact fluorescent lighting puts out. That's why there is a custom WB setting. When custom white-balance is used properly, colors are rendered nicely. In daylight, I have had no problems and under incandescent outdoor lighting it seems to render colors quite well.    Distortion: Most P&S cameras don't start out at 24mm equivalent on the wide end (one of the reasons that I bought the camera). If you are not used to composing using a wider-angle lens, your shots can produce some perspective distortion. Buildings and interiors need to be shot carefully at wide angles to minimize the ""leaning walls"" effect caused by the exaggerated perspective of wide angle lenses that is often mistaken for lens distortion. The lens itself is remarkably free of distortion at both the wide and long end of the zoom range. BTW, people shot up close with a wide-angle lens will NOT like how they look!    Lack of detail: The HX5V is not a DSLR. Its 10MP files will never support the detail that you can get with a large APS-C sensor. If you are obsessed with detail and like to view your pictures in minute detail at 100% zoom with your nose 12 inches away from your monitor, this is not the camera for you. That said, it will fit in your pocket and produce sharp, detailed images suitable for 8x10 prints or even larger...if used properly. Auto-ISO will automatically boost ISO in low-light conditions. As stated before, this camera is a compact, not a DSLR. Though it does better at ISO 800 than most, it still has a tiny sensor that is susceptible to noise and the accompanying loss of detail from noise reduction processing at higher ISO. In low light, I have used the hand-held twilight function with excellent results. This mode isn't magic and if the camera moves too much during the multiple exposures, it won't do the job. If you choose your subject well and keep the camera steady, the images in this mode can be very impressive. Digital zoom can cause problems at the long end. Since this feature simply takes a smaller center section of the image and blows it up, resolution suffers.  I'm happy with the 10x optical zoom and turning off the ""digital zoom"" option prevents its use and accidental image degradation.    iPanorama doesn't work: Nonsense. It is actually one of the best in-camera panorama solutions out there. Like everything else, there is no free lunch. You have to practice moving the camera steadily and smoothly across the scene and keep in mind that since it is using the video mode to capture the 100 or so image slices, you are limited to a 1080 pixel tall image (unless you trick it and use the vertical mode sideways to get a 1920 tall panorama).     In general, the HX5V will function as a point and shoot camera but to get the most out of its remarkable feature set, you need to take the time to learn the functions and how to best take advantage of what they have to offer. It is not a camera for everyone but it can be a great 24x7, take-anywhere tool with some class-leading features if use it well.    I have posted some images on my share site with examples of low-light, indoor, outdoor, panorama and extremes of the zoom range.     You can find them at: Well I guess you'll have to take my word for it. Whenever I post the link, Amazon moderators strip it out. Since there are no ads at the site I can't imagine they are fearing revenue loss to my humble competition. Look up the images gallery at Digital Photography Review for examples(a wholly owned subsidiary of Amazon). I'd post the link...but it might be removed by a moderator that doesn't know that they own DPReview    You can run a full-screen slide show of the images there as well.    If you want a great compact camera with a load of useful features and are willing to do some of the homework necessary to get the most out of it, the HX5V is an excellent choice. Get one and enjoy it!    Happy shooting!    Dave",,,,,,
67,sony,5,Hugh Watkins,"I've been waiting a long time for someone to develop this camera and Sony finally did it.    Pros: GPS, Compass, Picture Quality, AVCHD (1080i), Weight, Shutter Speed  Cons:   No GPS Coordinates on screen, just simple indication of GPS Lock  Compass Bearing hard to decipher, just simple compass needle    This camera is a winner, no it won't replace your GPS or your DSLR (ok honestly it may replace my DSLR, the image quality is fantastic!), but for what I wanted which is a way to record life from the hiking trail this is the camera to buy.    I run secretfalls dot com and I love to be out in the woods hiking, but lugging the DSLR, Camcorder and the GPS, then trying to Geocode after the trip was just time consuming and bulky.  I really wanted a small, light weight camera that would geo tag and shoot high quality video and the Sony DSC-HX5V is it.  I think the still image quality is as good as my Nikon DSLR, the video quality is not as high as my Sony Camcorder but is more than  excellent for the web footage I shoot.    The GPS once it has a lock appears very accurate, although it would be nice to have a screen to show actual coordinates to compare to my Garmin.  You can turn on the camera and shoot a picture in 2-3 seconds which is much better than my previous Nikon.    I ran through a couple of the shots I made looking at actual EXIF data for the GPS latitude and longitude, it looks to be accurate to around 15-20 feet when I have 3 satellite lock.  My Garmin GPS 60CSx is my gold standard and it can typically get me to within 5 feet.  The Sony apparently only locks onto 3 satellites and updates at 15 second intervals (I'm sure to save battery).  I'm not complaining this is excellent for my use.    *UPDATE Low light photography absolutely rocks on this camera, I've taken pictures while leaving work at dusk and the quality is still very good.  Can't wait to take some shots sitting around the campfire.",,,,,,

69,roku,5,sheine,"One can make a good case that with Roku you really don't need cable or satellite TV. With a $10 monthly subscription to Netflix you can get more movies than you have time for over the internet at the time that you want to see them. I doubt that one movie that TCM shows is not available this way.    You can listen to almost any radio station in the country free, meeting your needs if you like any particular kind of music or listen to talk radio, sports, etc.    You can watch Youtube clips on your big TV as well and can send the sound to your stereo system, home theater nowadays.    There are lots of other specialized sites, both free and by subscription, that are available. I like Pub-D-Hub which has movies in the public domain for free, many are poor but others can be quite good, I had never seen a picture with legendary Lillian Gish before.

71,Garmin Nuvi,4,John S. Dean,"Spent a weekend reviewing various GPS devices to replace my less than 1 year old Mio C320 (avoid these like the plague) that had its battery die about 4 months after purchase.  Went back and forth along the entire line of Garmin devices, and finally settled on this one for the blue tooth and traffic, neither of which I'll probably hardly ever use, but nice to have when I want them.      I was disappointed with the map, the ""new"" 2009 one, because I have some streets in my neighborhood that have been around for over four years and they're not to be found on this unit.  Even the piece of junk cheap Mio had these streets.     But that's about the only downside there is to it, the only reason I haven't given it 5 stars.    Having been used to the MIO, and the horrible refresh rate, it is a pleasant change to see smooth scrolling as my vehicle moves.  The ability to change the car icon is nice, especially with the plethora of icons available on the garmin website.    Accuracy is very good as well, and even in turns the unit isn't so laggy that it becomes annoying.  And also unlike what I was used to with the MIO, when I come to a stop at the intersection, the map doesn't start rotating randomly on me.    Speaker is about as I expected, won't hear much over a loud stereo but crank it up enough you can at least hear it if you keep the music down a bit.    The option to easily download voices is also appreciated.    It did well with my testing of going point to point, following the instructions, and for the most part you're given the instructions in plenty of time.  only once or twice did it not tell me ""turn right on such and such"" until I was about 20 feet from the street, but that was when I was coming up on stop signs and had slowed down, so it may be compensating for the speed factor.    Recalculation notice is a bit annoying, my MIO would say it once, sometimes this says it three times before it starts to display the alternate route.    Still has about 900MB free on the internal memory for additional voices, icons, maps, and such, and with the SD slot there's plenty of room to grow.    I have a Verizon XV6900 phone with Windows Mobile 6.1, and while the bluetooth paired well and it can see the phone status, battery power, signal, even dialed and missed call lists, it never does get the phonebook.  it gets a random entry and that's it - so whenever I turn it on, I have just one user to select from, and it's different each time.  Still haven't tracked that one down yet.  But every other bluetooth option worked just fine.    I'm not a fan of the very thick double power cable for it though, and it would be doubly annoying (no pun intended) if I were mounting this somewhere higher up on the window to have that double cable dangling down.    I can see how the ads would get annoying sometimes (the free traffic is because it is advertising driven) but you don't get them at all if you turn off the traffic feature, and since most of my driving isn't around times that traffic is a concern, i can just leave it for when I really have a use for it.    Good response to finger input, and while the unit is overall much better quality than the MIO, I really do miss the MIO's ability to have an info pane down the last third of the screen and the map on the first two thirds of it when desired.  But there's some of that info available in the data bubbles on the bottom and top so I'll survive.    Overall happy with the unit, it works well and was worth the cost.",,,,,,
72,Garmin Nuvi,5,Michael Simpson,"I have owned quite a few GPS units all including Phone, Laptop and Dedicated.  Flat out before I even get started the Garmin Nuvi 265WT is the best I have ever owned.   Let me just make a couple of comments on the most important features.    Touch Screen Interface  Very intuitive and easy to use.  Touch screen is responsive but not instantaneous.  What I particularly like is the ability to switch to a top down view by touching the screen.  Once done you can use your finger to drag the map around at any zoom point.  Once done you can hit the back button and resume your 3D view.    Turn by Turn  You have two options here.  You can use one of the Text to Speech voices or one of natural voices.  The text to speech voices will give you more information such as street names.  This is what I use and even though you can tell it's a computer generated voice its quality is superb.  The 265WT does a good job at keeping you updated.  Also at any time you can hit the turn Icon and it will speak the distance to the next turn, giving you street name as well as direction.   The audio is quite loud and in my noisy little Scion I have no problem hearing the messages.    Maps  I have found the map accuracy quite good.  I live in Northern virginal and it seems to be very well updated as many of the very new streets included.    Automatic Routing  Very effective.  You can choose between the quickest or the shortest with options to avoid U-Turns, Highways, Toll Roads, Traffic, Ferries.  The automatic rerouting is faster than my TeleNav phone and my Laptop computers.    Points of Interest  On my TeleNav phone GPS system I can enter any business in the national database and I can get directions, address and phone number.  This is where the 265WT falls short.  The TeleNav system has the advantage of searching online.  Since the 265WT is limited to onboard memory there is a limit to the number of points of interest. A good example is I was looking for ""Off Broadway Shoes"" and the unit could not find them.  However a search for ""Payless Shoes"" worked very well.    Traffic Alerts  The lifetime free traffic comes at a price.  You will get popup adds.  These are very small popups that supposedly only come when you  are in the menu.  This is not true.  I have gotten them while in the navigation screen.  For now they it seems to be once per trip but there is nothing to say they wont start getting more frequent.  The other thing I don't like about the messages is that you have to hit them to continue and doing so takes you out of the nav screen to a kind of favorites screen.  You have to hit the back button to get back to your navigations screen.   How well does the traffic system work.  I live in Northern VA and have coverage throughout my area.  The included radio fails to pick up a single signal without using an external antenna.  Sadly you can just go down and purchase an FM antenna..  The Power cable has a 3/32"" jack. What I did was to pick up a 3/32"" plug from Radio Shack and soldered a 4' wire to the tip pin on the connector.  Once draped out one of the windows I get very frequent traffic updates.    Once you start getting traffic reports I found them to be accurate and they do help.  You can automatically avoid high traffic arias or do it manually as they accrue.  I am still debating if the popup adds are worth the effort.      Bluetooth Integration  This is my favorite feature.  I can keep my keyboard locked Motorola Q in my pants pocket and use my 265WT to make and receive all my calls at a touch of a button.  All my phone features are available on the 265WT.  Phonebook, Call history, Voice Recognition.  The voice quality is quite acceptable on both ends.  As a matter of fact the echo I get on my Motorola is not there when using the 265WT as a hands free set.    Picture Viewer  I found this to be a very useless feature.  If the photos are very big it takes forever for the 265WT to load them.  This may be due to the slow access to the SD card slot.    There are other features like the ability to connect the 265WT to your PC and automatically add favorite locations using GoogleMaps.  All in all I am very happy with my purchase and would purchase it again.    FYI the Nuvi 265WT is the same unit as the Nuvi 255W without the Bluetooth ability and the FM reliever cable (GTM 25).  You can even purchase the GTM 25 from Garmin.  If you don't want the Bluetooth feature and don't currently need the traffic feature you can pick up the Nuvi 255W cheaper.  ",,,,,,
73,Garmin Nuvi,3,Larry K.,"I got this unit for Christmas, 2008. Although this is the first GPS that I've owned, I've been passenger on many trips with a friend who has Nuvi 350 so I was already familiar with Garmin. The unit I bought had the 2009 maps, and the firmware was fairly recent. Firmware, etc has since been updated to most recent version(s).  My choice came down to the nuvi 265WT, 765T or 760. The 760 is a premium unit for a bargain price due it's being last years model, while the 765T had the features I wanted but is still pricey since it's a new model. In the end I opted for 265WT since it had the updated/new features that the 760 didn't have and was at the price that I was willing to spend. I did not really consider other brands, though my impression is that other brands offer more ""bells and whistles"" but suffer in the areas of ease of use and reliability.  The unit has worked fine, no problems to speak of, though my actual time spend driving with it has been limited so far (spent lots of time just ""playing"" with it, though).    [update 9/11/09]  I've now used for a week of commuting to work and running errands. I use for commute because of the traffic reporting.    traffic -- haven't encountered a backup that it didn't warn me about, but have driven through a couple of non-existent backups. I've also found that it can take several minutes for the traffic status to be displayed after power-on, sometimes *after* it has picked a route.    routing -- the route it gives me to work is rather strange. It routes me off of the freeway onto an expressway that has several lights. I tried it once, and sure enough it took longer than predicted, even with light traffic.    reliability -- The unit has ""glitched"" 3 times in the last week. Once it just turned itself off, another time it jumped from the map to the speedometer screen (by itself) while the voice became very distorted, and another time the backlight setting was not as I had left it.  [end of 9/1/09 update]    My biggest complaint has to do with the POI database. For example, I searched for local cinema's... it did not have the 20 screen cineplex that is closest to me. When I searched for local Staples Office Supply locations the closest it found was 50 miles away, even though there are at least 4 within 15 miles. I didn't show a nearby Britannia Arms. A large regional shopping center is still called by a name that was dropped 5 years ago. etc...  The POI management software (such as it is) could use more flexibility. For example, when searching for Staples, the unit was ""busy"" quite some time searching. There appears to be no way to put a limit the search distance.  I think the map update policy is in need of revising. A two month ""grace period"" is not really fair to the buyers. Most of these are sold in Nov & Dec, and the maps are typically updated in the Spring, beyond the 60 day cutoff. Garmin should be guaranteeing map updates for at least 6 months, if not a year. Or, one free update within 2 years or something similar. Another gripe is the Garmin request for an ""account"" to register the unit. Yet another user name and password to forget.    [update 1/9/09]  At 2009 CES, Garmin announced a new map update policy. For $120 you get lifetime updates (""up to"" 4 times a year) while a single update will be $69, which (I think) is less than before.  [end of 1/9/09 update]",,,,,,
74,Garmin Nuvi,3,Linda C. Long,"This GPS is rated very highly, and that is why I bought it.  I have gotten refurbished phones before, so I didn't think it was a big deal to buy a refurbished gps.  Also, I now remember reading that someone had trouble getting the free map update. BEWARE!!  I have spent at least 4-5 hours total trying to get this update.  Long story short, after being on hold several times, faxing an invoice showing proof of purchase, waiting for them to update my account, and then downloading the update, clearing tons of space on my computer to transfer the update, I now have the update. I figure it would have been worth the extra $40 to get the new one (I got it for $179). The unit may be fine if you don't care about the free update. That much time and hassle is not ""free"".",,,,,,
75,Kindle_Dx,5,Alexander Scherr,"I have owned both Kindle 1 and Kindle 2, so I'm already committed to the basic idea: e-ink reading in a slim form factor with excellent connectivity to a large selection of books and subscriptions. I have come to rely on my Kindle experience, and it has seriously enhanced my reading.    The DX was not an obvious upgrade for me, but two features put me over the edge: the larger screen, and the native PDF reader. I now have the DX in my hands, and can report PROS, CONS, and NEUTRALS:    PROS:    -- the larger screen is a definite plus. I use the larger type size on my Kindle 2 (older eyes), and at this type size I get far more text per page on the DX. This makes the whole reading experience more book-like (and should be a boon to people who buy large-print books.)     -- the screen is also sharper and crisper than my Kindle 2 in a side-by-side comparison: the text is darker, and the contrast is much better, making for better visibility overall.    -- on a side note, the larger screen also makes it possible to read poetry on the kindle, even at large type sizes. On earlier Kindles, the smaller screen cut off lines, so that you would lose the sense of when the poet ended the line. On the DX, you can see the whole line exactly as the poet meant it, with the cut-off in the right spot.    -- the PDF reader works as advertised, and is extremely convenient. PDF documents appear on the DX exactly as they do on a computer screen. Moreover, you can drag and drop your documents directly to the device using the USB cable (or use the for-a-fee email if you absolutely must.) The only downside: at least for the documents that I've used so far, I cannot adjust the type size as I can with native Kindle documents.     -- screen rotation also works as advertised: it operates as a mild zoom on both graphics and text and offsets slightly the downside of not being able to adjust the typesize on PDF documents. One nice design touch: the four-way navigation stick introduced on the Kindle 2 is rotation-sensitive, and will move as expected relative to the screen rotation.    -- more of the device space is devoted to the screen, while the white plastic border around the screen seems to have shrunk, both in general and compared to the proportion of screen to plastic on the Kindle 2. I like this (but see below about the keyboard).    -- storage: I like the increase in storage space, and don't mind the lack of an external storage card. I can see some people having trouble with this, but only those folks who either a) must regularly carry around PDF documents totalling more than 3.5 GB of space or b) must have nearly 3500 books regularly at their fingertips. I fall in neither category.     CONS:    -- price: it's expensive, as you can tell pretty quickly. If you value the larger size, and the native PDF reader, these features may justify the roughly 30% premium you pay for the DX over the Kindle 2. In truth, the DX SHOULD cost more than the Kindle 2, and a 30% premium isn't unreasonable. But, for my money, Amazon should drop the price on the Kindle 2 to $300 or so, and charge $400 or a little less for the DX. Still, I bought it, and will keep it at this price.    -- one-sided navigation buttons: all of the buttons are now on the right side, and none are on the left. I'm a righty, so I shouldn't complain, but I found myself using both sides on the Kindle 2. Lefties have reason to complain, I think.    -- One-handed handling: I often read while I walk, with my Kindle in one hand, and something else in my other. Because of the button layout, this will be more difficult on the DX.    -- metal backing: I miss the tacky rubberized backing on my Kindle 1. When I placed my Kindle 1 on an inclined surface, it stayed in place. Not so my Kindle 2 and now my DX. This is not a complaint specific to the DX, but it's still there.    NEUTRALS (i.e. things worth noting):    -- weight: the DX is heavier, noticeably so. This is only an issue if, like me, you regularly use the kindle with one hand . . . and even so, it's still doable.     -- keyboard: the keyboard has 4 rows, and not 5: the top row of numbers from the Kindle 1 and 2 has been merged into the top qwerty row, so that numbers are now only accessible with an alt-key combination. The keys are vertically thinner too, so that the whole keyboard is no more than 1"" tall (compared to over an 1.5"" on the Kindle 2). At the same time, the keys themselves are a bit easier to press, a bit more protruding than on the Kindle 2. For someone with big fingers (like me), this will be a slightly harder keyboard to use, but only slightly.    That's all I can see. Overall, the pluses outweigh the minuses for me, and I'm satisfied with my purchase. I can now think of using my DX for work documents on a regular basis, because of the PDF reader. The screen size and screen rotation make the overall reading experience more immersive.     Overall, the DX feels more like text and less like device and comes closer to the stated goal of the Kindle: for the device to disappear, leaving only the joy of reading.                ",,,,,,
76,Kindle_Dx,3,Susan Lynn Umpleby,"This review was written back when the DX first came out and--as has been brought to my attention--needs to be updated a bit. I will indicate where things have changed for the better within the body of the review:    I owned the K1 and then the K2 and love them both, so I was really looking forward to the DX.  My plan was to use the DX at home, and keep my K2 for carrying all over creation with me. It wasn't long, though, after my DX arrived the day before yesterday before disappointment set in.    Don't get me wrong, there is a LOT to like about the DX:    1) Pictures are awesome on it, if the publisher formats them properly.    2) Those who complain about darkness of text on their K2 (a problem I've never had, btw) will be thrilled by the DX's very dark text.    EDIT:  LIKE THE KINDLE 3, THE DX NOW SPORTS A NEW E-INK DISPLAY THAT HAS MUCH BETTER CONTRAST, SO TEXT & PICTURES REALLY ""POP.""      3) The ability to rotate the screen is great.  Gives you a closer look at things like maps and charts.    4) The browser is a bit faster than on the K1 or K2, though that isn't saying much--it is still very clunky to use.    EDIT: THOUGH STILL CLUNKY, THE BROWSER *HAS* BEEN IMPROVED FOR EASIER USE.  BUT STILL DON'T PLAN TO DO A LOT OF WEB SURFING WITH IT.      5) But web pages look pretty good on the DX.    6) It holds 3500 books.      BUT.....the DX just isn't all that.  It has drawbacks that are really making me consider sending it back before my 30 days are up:    1) First and foremost, while it is true that it natively reads PDFs, it is really only a PDF *viewer*.  You can't change the font size on PDFs, links will not function on them, and the ability to magnify pictures doesn't work on them either. So you better have LARGE fonts on your PDF before you load it.  Looking at the PDF in horizontal mode helps a bit, but not by much.    EDIT: WE NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO ZOOM IN ON PDF DOCUMENTS, WHICH HELPS IN READING THEM--BUT IT WOULD STILL BEHOOVE USERS TO USE LARGER FONT SIZES IN DOCUMENTS BEFORE CONVERTING TO PDF FORMAT.        2) The DX is too big to hold comfortably.  It's not really all that heavy, but it is top heavy and you feel a pull on your hands.  And that pull is really evident if you try to use the keyboard while holding it--you practically have to lay the DX down flat, it becomes so difficult to type.    3) They merged the number keys with the QWERTY keys (losing a line of keys). What development genius thought it would be helpful and an ""improvement?""  To go to a location within a book you have to click Menu, choose ""go to,"" then click the Symbols key, choose the numbers you want, then close Symbols before you can choose ""location.""   Whew!  Or you can click Alt + the letter button at the top that corresponds to the number you want.  Joy.        4) Before my DX came, I really didn't think this would bother me at all, but I have to say: I really HATE the fact that the ""next page"" button is only on one side. I mostly use the left hand button. And yes, with the DX's rotation ability you can turn it upside down, placing the ""next page"" button on the left side.... However, when you do this, the button is so high up that you have to slide your hand (not your thumb, your whole hand) up in order to turn the page. May sound nit-picky, but it is truly a PITA to break off reading to do it. Not only that, but having the keyboard at the top makes it even more top-heavy than when it is right side up!    5) when you rotate the DX so that it is horizontal, the ""next page"" button is either at the bottom or the top--in either case you can't just flick your thumb and change the page. Again, a PITA.    6)  If you leave the rotation feature on ""Auto"" when you are not using your DX it drains your battery, so you must remember to turn the feature off when you stop reading.    7) Still no folders.  An organization nightmare three times bigger than that of the K2 (which itself had increased the same problem on the K1):  the possibility of storing 3500 books but only being able to sort them by author, title, and ""most recent first.""    EDIT: AMAZON HAS NOW GIVEN ALL KINDLE USERS THE ABILITY TO CREATE ""COLLECTIONS.""  THIS LETS YOU ORGANIZE YOUR BOOKS BY GENRE OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE, SO THAT'S A BIG HELP.  HOWEVER, FOR SOME STRANGE REASON, UNLESS YOU RESORT TO FIXES LIKE PUTTING SYMBOLS BEFORE THE COLLECTION NAMES WHEN IN ""VIEW BY COLLECTIONS"" IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ALPHABETIZE THEM! I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS GETS FIXED IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH A SOFTWARE UPDATE.        I will be fiercely debating with myself in the next week or so, on whether I really want to keep the DX.  It is so disappointing.  It has the potential of being a really great e-reader...but as it stands now, it isn't.  It's OK.  But for $489, it should be a lot more than merely OK.    EDIT: I DID END UP RETURNING MY DX THE FOLLOWING WEEK. THE PRICE HAS SINCE DROPPED--IT NOW COSTS $379--BUT IT *STILL* ISN'T ALL THAT.  ",,,,,,
77,Kindle_Dx,4,C. Vincent,"First off, I am a first time kindle buyer, so this review will be more geared to those buyers thinking of entering into the kindle market, not a comparison of past editions.     My first impression of the Kindle DX was that it was actually very small compared to what I expected. The entire device is slightly smaller (in height and width) than a piece of paper, with the screen taking up approximately 85-90% of the front. This was actually a nice surprise, since I wanted something very portable, but good for magazines/research articles. After seeing the size of the DX, I think a K2 would have been way too small for what I want. At the same time, the device is very hefty. Picking it up, it becomes almost tiring to hold up in one hand for too long (another reason I think this one is better geared toward short articles instead of extended novel reading). It has a nice solid feel to it, but for some reason I was expecting it to be lighter.    The kindle only takes a couple of seconds to power up and immediately goes to the last article you were reading. A row of buttons are positioned on the right, which let you go to the main home page, go to the next page of an article, previous page, bring up a menu, or go ""back"". There is also a small four-way joystick to navigate around (which also has the ability to be pressed for selections). The joystick is very sensitive and easy to navigate with, although not overly sensitive that you hit things by mistake (at least very often - it has happened a couple of times so far).     For those in the market for an ereader and can't decide between the Kindle and another device, I can tell you what made me go toward the Kindle: Whispernet. It is a free, no subscription based service that comes on all Kindles. You get free access to the internet anywhere Sprint reception can be found. You can purchase books/magazines/newspapers anywhere, and have them in less than 60 seconds. You can access the web, check your web-based email, look up directions, find weather reports, movie times, etc. Although the Kindle terms say that normal web browsing might result in extra charges, my assumption is that this clause will just cover amazon if they choose to charge for web in the future. As of right now, everything is free. The Web Browser is very rudimentary and does not show pages very well. Even most pages designed for mobile phones showed up badly for me, although some were okay. The browser is very slow, but could really come in handy if some information was needed and no internet was available.     I have tried several blogs and magazines, as well as the native pdf viewer and all seem to produce well formatted articles with crisp, clear pictures. Lighter pictures tend to show up better as darker pictures blur together if they do not have enough contrasting elements. The one problem I have noticed with the pdf viewer is that some text/elements can end up being very small and hard to see. The pdf viewer is stuck on one size, which is slightly smaller than most pdf's are intended to be viewed at. There is no way to increase font size, and the only way to zoom is by rotating the display. This zooms in on the top or bottom half of the screen. Rotating to a landscape display actually helps that problem a great deal, but some sort of zoom feature would have been nice. You can search in pdf documents or go to certain pages, but it is impossible to annotate as the Kindle lets you do in normal document files. Pdf documents can be sent to the Kindle DX via usb cable or through a special email that is set up for the device. However, documents that are sent via email are charged a small fee (I was charged $0.45 for a pdf slightly larger than 2MB - I will use the usb cable from now on unless it's absolutely necessary to use email). Blogs I have subscribed to have continuously updated over the time I've had the DX... it is nice to have a constant stream of info to read even when not in the position to surf the web. Most blogs and magazines are subscription based with costs ranging from free to $1.99 or more for the more popular ones. This fact turns many people off since blogs can be found free on the net, but the convenience of having them constantly updated with no internet connection required and brought to you in an easy to read format makes them somewhat worth it in my opinion. Having read through some and watched constant updates while writing this review, I think I will be more likely to keep the blog subscriptions even more than the magazines subscriptions. Most blogs and magazines give you a 14-day trial to see how well you like them before committing to a purchase. They can be organized into separate articles/sections, and are easy to navigate.      There is a text-to-speech function that can be used in most books (Random House published books excluded because of a lawsuit brought against amazon). The sound of it seems a little old fashioned with an extremely computer-sounding voice, but it is a nice addition. You can also play MP3's, but don't expect extremely high-quality sound. The Kindle DX has a earphone jack on the top of the device, or small speakers on the bottom of the device for these funtctions.     A keyboard is present at the bottom of the device. It has a QWERTY format, but with the numbers located on the top row of letters (a shift button selects them). It is fairly easy to type on in my opinion, but takes a little getting used to. The buttons are small, rounded and don't take much to push. For this reason, it is difficult to tell if you hit the button acurately or not, and often times you find you hit wrong keys by accident. The Kindle actually tends to be a bit wide to easily type if you have small hands like me. Larger hands should do fine.     As for the screen, the e-ink is easy to read, easy on the eyes, and it is crisp and has a nice resolution. Highly detailed pictures showed up nicely as long as they weren't too dark. The only complaint I would have about the screen is that it is very reflective. I need to make sure I'm not around any bright lights before reading. Otherwise, the glare interferes.     SHOULD YOU BUY THE DX?: Well, I think that comes down to what you want to read. The DX is a nice reader (although expensive!). It is probably the perfect size for reading magazine articles, journal articles, and newspapers. The articles come out as being crisp and easy to read, and having them constantly delivered to you is great. I think the device might be a little on the heavy/large side for continous reading of books, so for that, I would probably go with the Kindle 2 instead. For textbooks, I think the verdict is still out. Being able to flip through the pages of textbooks and quickly find information still isn't completely replicated by the Kindle. However, the search features of the Kindle could prove to be invaluable in studying, and there's no doubt the kindle helps in areas of portability. The DX replicates figures and images nicely, but in some textbooks, color is vital. That could be the downfall of the DX when it comes to Textbooks.     CONS/FOR FUTURE KINDLES: There's quite a few things that prevent the DX from being perfect, but maybe they can be added into future editions. First and foremost: Folders/Organization! Right now, all articles/blogs/newspapers/books get clumped together in one big menu. Why is there no way to organize these and place them in categories? This would be a huge improvement and would take very little effort. Also: Color. As I just mentioned above, color is a huge part of many textbooks, articles, etc. As soon as the technology is ready, a color kindle will be a huge improvement. A memory card slot was included in the first Kindle; however it was removed in the second and DX. This needs to be added back. Especially for those of us with large pdf libraries, we need the extra memory slot. Not to expand the memory so much as to just give us a portable way of getting articles onto the kindle. As of right now, you can be charged to have articles sent to the Kindle, or we can be near a computer. Why not add the memory card slot back and give us one more option? A better web browser, some sort of side-lighting for nighttime reading, touchscreen, thinner, and lighter are other suggestions I can think of to strive for.    UPDATE: So, after using the DX for a while now, I have come to absolutely love it. Unfortunately, so has my girlfriend, so I don't get to see it much anymore.     A few small things have come to annoy me though, so I would like to point those out. First, the screen rotation is becoming more and more annoying. I find the screen rotating on me many times when I don't want it to. Slightly changing the position of the device suddenly leads to the screen being rotated, and then it takes another few seconds of shifting it around to get it back the way you want. There should be a way to turn screen rotation off if you know you won't want it bothering you for a while. A simple setting could then be turned on again for normal use. (UPDATE: Apparently, you can disable the auto-rotation. User A.Nichols wrote in the comments: ""Push the button with the Aa (to change font size) and you'll find the option to set change screen rotation from Auto (default) to portrait. I found the screen rotation to be annoying also when reading, it's easy to accidentally change the angle."")    Another thing that has come to bother me is the screen lag. Very often, it's as though the screen sticks after you push buttons. You push them again and again, and then the screen finally unsticks and you fly through 3-4 pages. It's difficult to tell if the device didn't register the button you pushed or if it's just running behind. Unfortunately, this has resulted in my purchasing a book that I didn't mean to (amazon was nice enough to remove the charge though). Usually you get a ""Would you like to cancel your order?"" immediately after purchasing on the kindle, but this time I guess I pushed too much and flew through that screen too.     Even with these small issues, I can't put my Kindle down. It is the best money I have spent in a long time.     ",,,,,,
78,Kindle_Dx,5,Mahlers2nd,"July 5 update:  I've apparently been living under an e-reader rock because today is the first day I hear of the new dark gray DX.  If you are contemplating the whether to go with the white or gray DX -- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!!  Get the gray!! The one thing I learned with my Sony Readers is that the darker the bezel -- the more contrast between the screen and the easier it is to read.  So even if the screen and nothing in the e-ink display has changed and everything else is the same except for the color of the bezel -- the darker bezel will make for an easier more constrasty reading experience.  FINALLY, Amazon gets a clue and realizes that the darker bezel will make for better reading though it may not look as ""nice"" as the white!    FIRMWARE UPDATE as of 11.30.2009:    I have now <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BUQ6FU"">M-Edge Platform Jacket for Kindle DX (Genuine Leather--Pebbled Navy)--Back to School Sale!!</a> because you can set the Kindle up to stand by itself on the table next to you or a lap desk.  This makes it easier to to view music, knitting patterns, or just plain books (addressing some users complaints about it being ""too heavy"" to hold comfortably).     I had been disappointed that the Kindle automatically goes to sleep after 5 minutes because if you are using the Kindle for reading patterns or music, it times out on you while you are still ""working"" on a page. However, Amazon come out with a new firmware release...  the Kindle DX now stays on for 20 minutes before going into screen saver mode which is a big improvement.      In addition, with the new firmware, you have the option of converting your PDFs to Kindle format -- which should address the lack of ""zoom"" and ""annotation"" features -- at least there is a workaround for now.      UPDATE as of 06.16.2009:  The Kindle may have just literally saved my career and saved my ""backend"".  I had an interview yesterday and thought I knew where I was going.  I'm one of the last dinosaurs not to have a Garmin and got lost.  After circling around for awhile and getting more and more uptight about missing my interview, I remembered the Browser on the Kindle.      On the K2, the browser was basically unusable because of the size.  However, with the DX, I was able to go to Google Maps, look up the address and had my directions in just a couple of seconds.  The map was rendered beautifully and the turn-by-turn directions could be bookmarked and even if my DX fell asleep, it awoke still displaying the directions.  THANK YOU KINDLE!!!    ---------------------------------------------    The UPS truck arrived a couple of hours ago.  I feel like a kid on Christmas Day and I got (just about) everything I wanted!    My Sony PRS-505 has finally and officially become my ""Emergency Backup Reader""    My romance with ebook readers got off to a bumpy start when I got my first eInk device -- the Cybook Bookeen.  Firmware issues and awkward buttons made it rather disappointing.    Then I found true love with the Sony PRS-505.  I loved the metal case.  I loved the ""Collections"" (essentially folders features).  I loved the looks and loved the display.      However, the Kindle 2 woo'ed me with the size of its content collection.  However, for reading I still ultimately preferred my Sony.    Now, with the larger Kindle DX, I've set my Sony aside and there is a new love in my life.  Let me count the ways:    1.      SCREEN SIZE:   Reading on the Kindle DX vs 6"" readers is like the difference between sleeping in a King sized bed vs a Twin Bed or riding in the backseat of a 2-door 1981 Honda Accord vs bucket seats in a Honda Odyssey.  You feel like you have room to breath.  The larger screen allows you to maximize the use of the real estate -- taking advantage of larger fonts and more white space.  This makes text much easier to read -- even if you are just reading regular books.    2.       KEYBOARD:  I also love that they have compacted the keyboard so that it doesn't dominate the overall appearance of the device.  The smaller keyboard in no way compromises the ability to type.  However, it improves the look by making the proportions more appealing and it means the device isn't horrifically larger than the 6"" device.      3.      PDF + BIG SCREEN = LOTS MORE USES:  I can transfer my knitting patterns (complete with knitting graphs and diagrams) and cello music to my e-reader.      Using the Kindle for knitting -- I can highlight my place in the knitting pattern making it easier to work more complicated stitch patterns.      I play cello and many of my music books are available in PDF format -- again the Kindle is wonderful for carrying all my music with me at one time.  Turning pages is faster and easier than with a physical book.  The kindle sits well on the music stand (though you want to make sure the tray of the music stand is taller than the Kindle or the Kindle will be ""top heavy"" making the bottom slide forward and potentially falling off the stand.     4.     SCREEN ROTATION -- You can rotate the screen in any direction and the page quickly re-orients itself.  You can keep rotating 360 degrees and the screen follows you.  The buttons remain the same but the thumb stick also reorients so that if you push right relative to the current orientation, that always means ""page forward"" no matter what direction you are in.      If you are left handed and really bothered by having the buttons only on the right side, you can turn the device upside down and voila -- now your buttons are on the left side.      5.  BUTTON CONFIGURATION -- I actually PREFER having the next page and back page on the same side and in a contiguous location (as opposed to opposite sides of the device like the Kindle 2).  It makes one-handed reading easier without having to reach over to the other side of the device to flip back and forth.    6.     SOLID feeling -- I like the heavier feel -- it is comparable to the heft of a hardbound book.     7.     READING While charging -- this sounds like a little thing but with the Sony, if you have the device plugged in for charging, you can't read on the device at the same time.        There are a two things I still think the Sony does better:    1.     COLLECTIONS:   It would be nice to have folders so that music could be separated from technical books which is also separated from knitting patterns etc.  The absence of folders is even MORE annoying on the DX because you are likely to have a much more diverse collection of books/documents on there.      2.     EPUB SUPPORT:  ePUB would allow users to acquire content from public libraries and virtually any other online ebookseller.  But that is basically why Amazon isn't doing that... they WANT you to only get your content from them.  Frankly, the ability to view PDFs without having to do a bunch of emailing back in forth is a huge leap forward so I guess it is sort of a ""baby steps"" thing.       Sony has just really dropped the ball by not bringing out a larger format.  You wouldn't think that a couple of extra inches on the screen would make that much of a difference in terms of your reading enjoyment.  But then again, going from a 17"" monitor to a 19"" monitor is a huge difference in terms of usability of a computer screen.    All in all -- Amazon really made a brilliant move with the DX.  It is clear that they have really thought through the little things this time around and even the DX is a substantial improvement over the K2.  I'm very very happy!    [NCJAR]",,,,,,
79,Kindle_Dx,1,D. Leaf,"My Kindle DX shipped July 30.  I really liked it until today.  There is a white out on about 1/12 of screen so you cannot read many words on the page and the text is running veritical and horizontal at the same time. The product has not been dropped or otherwise damaged during use.   When I called Amazon Kindle support they said they had never heard of problem, even though I told them I found in a few seconds on the web.  They asked me to reset, which I did, but problem persisted.  I was then told that the problem was not covered by warranty!!!!!!!!!!!  I asked how could they know that without looking at device and they said it was not on known list of manufacturer defects.  They told me to not even bother sending it in for warranty service but if I wanted a new one, I could pay them $250.00!!  I spoke to 2 supervisors at the Washington call center who gave me the same line.  Amazon is not standng behind this product, and this is the worst example of poor customer service I have encountered.  I asked them how could they make a technical diagnosis over phone and they had no good answer, just kept repeating that it was not a covered defect.  I asked them why they would not just say ""send it in and we will take a look at it"", and they said it was a waste of time because it was not covered (even though they were 3000 miles away from unit and had not seen it)  They wiggled when I demanded a written explanantion of denial of warranty service ( which to me is breach of contract.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015TCML0"">Kindle DX: Amazon's 9.7"" Wireless Reading Device (Latest Generation)</a>  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.

80,Kindle_Dx,4,D. H. O'CONNOR,"I don't generally write reviews, but I hope this one will be useful for other scientists who are contemplating a Kindle DX. My use for the DX will be different from most of the users who have posted reviews. I maintain a library of nearly 4,000 PDF manuscripts/grants/documents. I probably have minimal use for eBooks from the Kindle Store. The number of PDFs is constantly growing as new research manuscripts are published (and downloaded to my computer). My principle reasons for purchasing a DX were to:    1) Carry the electronic equivalent of binders of PDFs with me when traveling. An iPod for PDFs. This is a metaphor that works for the way that I view an eReader, though it probably doesn't apply equally well to everyone.    2) Have an easier way to read papers when traveling. Easier means not worrying about battery life, unfurling a laptop in a cramped airplane, or carrying a bag full of papers.    3) Reduce eye strain from staring at a computer screen by moving serious reading from the laptop screen to the DX.    From my preliminary use, I think the DX is a qualified success. Text in manuscripts looks great. Figures from manuscripts do not render well in portrait mode if there is a lot of detail; switching to landscape mode helps substantially. Zoom into individual images/sections of PDFs would be welcome.     Navigating large numbers of PDFs from the home screen is currently clumsy. Lack of directory support to organize large numbers of files is an issue. I've read about users using complex naming conventions to use 'search' as an indirect way to find files. Renaming hundreds (or thousands) of files to make them easier to find is not a great solution. I suspect this will improve in time, either through a firmware update to this device or in the next generation of hardware.     I'm also hoping against hope that one or more of the reference manager software providers (Bookends, I'm looking at you) realizes that their software is to the Kindle as iTunes is to the iPod. If I could manage the content of my Kindle through a reference manager, I would be thrilled. The idea of downloading a paper and syncing it in one step to the Kindle to take with me is really appealing. This wouldn't completely overcome the problem with a flat file hierarchy once the papers are on the Kindle, but it would help organize getting content onto and off the device.     The biggest surprise to me is the functionality of the web browser. Yes, it is pokey to render pages. No, I wouldn't want to use it to web surf. But if I had a destination web site that is heavy on content, I think reading on the Kindle will be vastly superior to reading on the iPhone or other mobile/tablet devices. I do doubt, however, that wireless data access will remain free on the Kindle long-term. I can't imagine how Amazon will be able to continue subsidizing the data costs. I think that this is a feature that should be enjoyed while it lasts, but I wouldn't be surprised if it goes away at some point in the future.    Though it adds another $50 to the cost, I think the matching case is attractive, functional, and creates an easy-to-carry package.     So is it worth the high cost? I don't think I (or anyone) can really evaluate that until determining how well it integrates into daily work habits. I suspect that I will get heavy use out of it, but then I read a ton of PDFs. I do hope that the PDF support for dictionary lookup, highlighting, and annotation improves, but I base my review on what the product does - not what I would like it to do.     Hope this helps other heavy PDF users!",,,,,,
81,Kindle_Dx,3,John Pittard,"As a grad student who is tired of printing out scores of journal articles or straining my eyes (and sucking battery power) reading them on a conventional computer screen, I have been eagerly watching the evolution of e-book devices waiting for one that would meet the needs of academics and professionals who are constantly reading, highlighting, and annotating documents and books. Because Amazon has marketed the Kindle DX as the e-reader for academics and professionals, highlighting its large screen and native PDF support, I finally thought that this was a product suitable for types like me and forked out the five hundred dollars for the DX. Alas, upon receiving the Kindle yesterday in the mail, it did not take long to realize that this machine is not the ""answer"" that I had hoped it would be. The reason is simple: no highlighting or annotating PDFs, Word documents, and other personal documents. It did not even occur to me to inquire, before purchasing the DX, whether highlighting and annotating PDFs and Word docs was possible. After all, one can easily acquire free software that enables one to do this on a computer (e.g. Skim for Macs), and in the Kindle DX press conference Amazon made a big deal about bringing reality to paperless workplaces, putting an end to the routine of printing out document after document. Well, surely one of the major reasons people print out documents is so that they can mark on them with underlinings, highlights, and notes. And given that one cannot do that for PDFs and other documents on a Kindle DX, Amazon's sales pitch is quite misleading: anyone who needs to interact with documents in the way typical of academics and professionals will still need to print out those documents (or make due on an eye-straining and power-consuming computer). Not only is it impossible to add an annotation to a specific passage in a PDF or Word document, one cannot add any annotations whatsoever, even at the page level (or document level, for that matter). Clipping/highlighting support is also completely absent. This is frankly unacceptable for a product marketed as the Kindle for students and professionals.    As I'm sure other reviews here will attest, the Kindle DX is in other respects a beautiful and wonderful machine. If you just want to read PDFs, and have no desire to annotate or highlight them, then this would be a very satisfying device. And if you only need to annotate and/or highlight books (and can find the books you need in the Kindle store and can afford to buy them!), then the DX will be a wonderful piece of equipment to own. But if you are a typical student, academic or professional who needs to interact with your documents (and not just read them), and are looking for something that will replace the need to print documents or read them on your computer, the DX simply does not fit the bill. Wait for the next product, or for Amazon to update their firmware with respectable support for PDFs and other document types. I'll be mailing my Kindle back to Amazon tomorrow.",,,,,,
82,Kindle_Dx,1,D. Hewes,"First, let me say that I purchased and use my Kindle DX daily.  I thought about how to accurately write this review for some time now.  When it gets right down to it, all eReaders on the market - and the flood now hitting the market - use the same e-ink panels made by the same company, generally have the same features as far as reading an actual book, etc. When this was a niche product in a market with no real competition than the product would get a much higher rating.  However, it is now a market with many choices.  The only way to be fair about writing a review is to assume that there are some basic functions that MUST exist (wireless access, reader screen quality, basic zoom/bookmark features, etc.) that all e-readers today have.  The review should be what is UNIQUE about the Kindle DX and review those features.  If you just want to download a book and read it on an e-ink panel than every single e-reader on the market today will work fine.    To that end, when looking at what makes the DX unique, I have to honestly say that I would not purchase this reader again - there are better options out there with several more just announced. After careful consideration, it becomes clear that Amazon just felt that they could get away with a sub-par device based on their name and position in the market.    1) PDF issues: This is a larger format reader, presumably for the purpose of reading standard sized documents (8.5"" by 11"").  It is also being marketed heavily to students.  Both of these demand native full PDF support.  While the Kindle DX does render PDF's, it does so in an extremely crippled way.  While I am well versed with the fact that some PDF's are rendered as images and the document itself does not contain links or text, most do.  Despite that fact the Kindle does not allow you to change font size, add bookmarks, highlight text, use the dictionary feature, zoom in, use any links (i.e., the Table of Contents), etc.  In other words, it presents that pages as pictures and provides absolutely zero ""digital control"" over the documents - the very features that someone would want to use an electronic reader instead of a hardcopy for.  I purchased this device as an engineer because I have hundreds of PDF's (manuals, client systems documentation, etc.).  I have found that I am completely unable to use it for the reason I purchased it for. Other readers treat PDF's as any other document allowing all the same e-reader functions and there is no reason - short of not wanting to pay Adobe a license fee - that the Kindle does not have this same functionality.    2) File formats:  While the Kindle DX does support several file formats, Amazon is one of the last holdouts to insist on providing content in a DRM protected proprietary format.  They also do not read many industry standard formats.  CHM and LIT are two of the HUGE formats that come to mind.  Many publishers - especially of technology books - release in CHM format, essentially a slightly marked up HTML derivative that should be easy to render.  MOBI and others come to mind as well - with over 1,000,000 public domain titles available from many web sites in these other formats.  Yes, I understand protecting content - but Amazon has gone overboard in trying to lock down the Kindle to only offer ""all the features"" on their proprietary format.  This locks you in to buying eBooks from the Kindle store.  I understand the financial drive to do that - but most of us have documents that we have created, or content we have previously purchased for other platforms and have rights to, that we would like to read on the Kindle.  Devices that restrict access to their own formats are generally given away or sold for a very low cost, with the understanding that the profit will be made on content (think about some of the original movie on demand set-top devices).  Amazon is selling this as a standalone device, and needs to not intentionally cripple it.  And yes, there are tools to convert file type - which usually result in formatting issues and the burden should be placed on the end user.    3) File System Flaws:  Amazon advertises the ability to hold 3,500+ books/documents (a HUGE exaggerating in and of itself).  Even if it held 350 titles, the file system has a HUGE problem.  There are no ways to create any type of folder structure.  You have to go to a single large flat listing of the documents on the reader and hit Next Page over and over - a painfully slow process in and of itself - and hope do don't miss the title you were looking for and have to start over.  Yes, the titles do start in alphabetical order, but they change based on most recently read being moved to the top.  It is a ridiculous and unrealistic expectation to put more than a couple dozen documents on a device without any way to organize them into folders.  The official Amazon reply:  You can add tags and search by tags.  Yep, you can - and if you want to take the couple weeks it would take to add tags to a couple thousand PDF's then you have far more free time than I do.  The Kindle was purchased to save time - not to use my entire annual vacation time to organize it.    4) No Card Reader:  For some unknown reason, Amazon decided to not include any type of card reader.  The memory can hold a large number of books - but PDF's can get to be 100MB or more if they are heavily diagrammed.  The memory cannot be upgraded, so there should be some method to pop in a memory card.  All of my cells phones have had this feature...and my $500 Kindle DX does not?     5) Ergonomics:  I admit that the e-reader market is emerging so there has not been a large pool of users to pull opinions from.  That said, it seems that the Kindle DX made it through the art department and skipped the usability testing department.  While it looks great and each to carry, the 5-way joystick thing, the lack of Next/Previous page buttons on both sides (that existed on previous models) and the absolute worst keyboard I have ever touched do not help the device.  Again - being marketed to students and professionals - just look at the official page on the Amazon site.  What is on the screen on the largest image there?  It is a power plant diagram - not a page from a NYT Best Seller list.  There should be a way to quickly type notes on things.  There is no possible way a student could sit in a lecture and flip through pages and be able to type in notes and keep up with the class on this thing - completely unrealistic.     6) No Desktop Application: While Amazon advertises that no computer is required, they leave out the fact that even if you had one there isn't really anything you could do with it.  There should be some application similar to Apple's iTunes that will auto convert file formats and allow organization of files and folders (if they existed), allow backup in case the device is lost/stolen/damaged and needs to be replaced, etc. This is especially true for students that would desire a full sized keyboard to add notes to documents/books and sync with the Kindle.    Bottom line: The Kindle DX is an absolutely great e-reader for someone that wants to simply read books, is comfortable buying only Kindle content and just desires a larger screen.  This is what I am now using it for.  To this end it works great.  If this is your only expectation - then get out the credit card.  If you have fantasies of using it to actually read PDF's with any functionality, store a large number of documents, use it in a classroom setting, etc. then get a different e-reader and sacrifice battery life and get a tablet or laptop and wait for the next generation.

83,Kindle_Dx,1,science guy,"UPDATE 8/21/09:  Though the commenter's advice to contact Mr. Cuomo was tempting, I instead decided to write a very polite letter to Amazon. They came to their senses and promptly sent me a replacement unit. I would like to thank Jennifer B. from Amazon for resolving this issue. My original review remains below although I regret the bit about the Amazon reps getting zero stars. I suppose on average they deserve 2.5.        A few days after I received my Kindle DX, I placed it in a protective case (purchased from Amazon), in a bag, in the trunk of my car. When I took it out, the display was not working. There were strange patterns of lines on the display, although the screen showed no signs of physical damage. Naturally, I called Amazon to arrange for a replacement or repair. As soon as I began talking to the rep, I immediately got the feeling that they were trying to blame me for the issue. I assured her that I treated my kindle with care, even going to the trouble of using a protective case. I sent a photo of the display and they informed me that the photo 'confirmed' that I had damaged the kindle. While I told them it was possible that the screen could have been physically damaged at some point, as I do not monitor it 24/7, it was highly unlikely to have happened in the trunk of my car. For all I know, the damage happened during shipping/before I received it, and it only manifested itself after a short period of time. I told them very nicely, but firmly, that I had done nothing to damage the kindle in the trunk of my car. They basically told me that it was my fault and there was nothing they could do.    It clearly was not my fault; even if 'damage' happened while it was in my possession, it would only be because the kindle is so fragile that even in a highly protected environment it was damageable. And again, I highly doubt that this occurred in the first place.    However, since I value my time and dislike arguments, I was willing to settle for less than a full refund/replacement. I told them that since a large portion of the purchase price goes to cover the wireless service, I simply requested a refund for a couple hundred dollars since I would obviously not be using the wireless service. This request was denied. Instead, they offered me a $20 credit toward new books (which by the way has not shown up on my account yet).    I have to say that, as a long time Amazon customer, I am extremely disappointed. I have purchased hundreds (maybe thousands) of items from Amazon and I do not recall having ever returned anything that was opened or removed from the box. I brought this to the supervisor's attention and pointed out that, based on my history, I am unlikely to be a customer who damages his items and then tries to transfer the loss to the seller. I also pointed out that I have done extremely good marketing for them by speaking highly of Amazon at every opportunity, and would appreciate it if they would be willing to make an exception to their strict policy, which in my view clearly punishes some innocent parties to protect amazon from a few unscrupulous customers. I thought it would be clearly in their interest to work out some kind of reasonable repair/refund arrangement, but there was no sympathy of any kind from them.    The lessons should be clear. (1) If your kindle stops working, whether it is your fault or not, be prepared for Amazon to blame you. (2) If you ever plan to take the kindle more than 3 feet from your desk/bed, take your advice from the Amazon rep's own words: the covers you purchase on Amazon.com don't protect the screen from damage. (3) Like many of you, I had never had a real conversation with Amazon customer service (until this incident). I was very surprised with how unsympathetic they were to someone with such a long customer history. I can't even imagine how they treat their newer/smaller customers!    I recommend against the purchase of the Kindle DX unless a loss of $500 would be trivial to you. I give the Kindle DX one star and I give the Amazon reps zero.",,,,,,
84,Kindle_Dx,1,Jill Talbot,"Do not buy this kindle and their ""accompanying"" leather case!  They encourage you to buy the leather cover for this (made by amazon specifically for this kindle)and do not tell you it will CRACK your Kindle.  I paid $489 for a kindle that is now completely cracked.  When I called customer service they claimed it was ""user error"" on how I was opening and closing the case. It is like a book, not hard to open.  It is clearly not designed properly and they include no instructions or warnings with the cover saying this might happen.  Unfortunately I was not one of the ""lucky"" ones who got theirs replaced like a few others have noted, apparently they are not doing this anymore which is unacceptable for a $489 piece of equipment to crack.  Very disappointing....",,,,,,
85,Kindle_Dx,2,Fred Bacon,"Okay, not yet a complete week.  It's only been five days.      Monday got off to a bang.  My first experiments were very promising.  I put several PDF files on the Kindle DX to see if they would be readable.  To my delight, the programmers were smart enough to use the media bounding box and not the page size to determine what to draw on screen.  The page margins are redundant on the Kindle.  The device's plastic border serves as a margin.  Let's see what this puppy can do.  I throw some LaTeX generated pdfs on it.  The older of these files use Postscript Type 3 embedded fonts.  They use bit mapped fonts set designed for a specific device resolution--a 600 dpi printer.  The Kindle scales everything beautifully.  Nice.    I put some papers from SIGGRAPH meetings on my Kindle.  These pdfs contain a lot of color graphics.  It's the Special Interest Group Graphics of the ACM after all.  I don't expect much, but let's stress the system.  Even with only 16 grey levels, Kindle manages to produce a reasonable representation of the figures.  It kind of takes me back to days of viewing images on my old Mac Plus.  The algorithms have been around for years.  Even given the low dynamic range of E-ink, they manage to do a pretty good job.  The results are serviceable for the platform.  No real complaints here.  SIGGRAPH papers are double column and printed on paper that is bigger than the Kindle DX.  Even just zooming on the media bounding box, the fonts are kind of small.    Tuesday.  Let's start moving journal articles over to the Kindle.  These are papers purchased from places like the Journal of Physical Chemistry, etc..  Hmm, double column articles with complex mathematics are a bit of a problem in portrait mode.  By the time you put an exponent on a term in the numerator of a term in the denominator of an integral, the font size is getting pretty small.  Turn the Kindle to enter landscape mode.  Everything rescales, and the math is readable again.  But a complete page doesn't fit on screen.  I expected that.  Just click the next page button.  When the Kindle is sideways, the buttons are in an awkward position.  Rats.  Furthermore, the article is two column.  In landscape mode, you have to hit those buttons a lot.  Next page, next page, previous page, next page...zig-zagging my way through the text.  I think I'll stick to portrait mode except when I need to really see the equations in detail.    Wednesday.  My hobby is history.  A few months back, I downloaded the complete set of scanned PDFs of the Nuremburg trials.  The National Archives have them available for download.  They are government documents so they aren't protected by copyright.  They are no longer in print, and buying the full set from used book dealers would cost thousands of dollars.  The full set of scanned documents is about 2 gigabytes of files.  I only have 3.3 gigabytes of storage available.  I probably don't want to take up all of my space with just these files.  I put a few volumes on the Kindle.  The pages are rendered clearly.  I can still search the OCR'ed text of the files.  It's a shame there isn't sufficient room to put them all on my Kindle.    Thursday.  I need to replace the hard drive and add memory to my laptop.  I download the PDF manual from the manufacturer to get instructions.  Success!  The Kindle is perfect for this job.  Laptop is disassembled while flipping through the pages of the manual.  I didn't have to print out the instructions.    Uh-oh.  Suddenly realized that there is no password protection on the Kindle.  I have a few business documents on it which I'm going to have to remove.  Why can't I password protect this thing?  It's so tempting to put business documents on it.  I'll have to remember not to do that.  If I lose my Kindle, it could be a problem.    Trying to read my Kindle in bed.  I've got nearly a hundred pdf files on the Kindle now.  I've been cleaning out my filing cabinets of software manuals and printed copies of papers.  It's starting to get cluttered.  Dragging files into folders organizes them on the Kindle's disk, but the table of contents still only has one level.  I have to flip through several pages of titles to find the article that I want.    Friday.  Why is this thing getting slow?  Turning the pages on some of my pdfs takes 30 or 40 seconds.  Uh-oh, some of these pages aren't being scaled correctly.  The fonts are tiny.  The text only partially fills the screen.  This page rendered perfectly yesterday.  What gives?  I think they may have a memory leak.  Is there some way to make this thing reboot?  Simply putting it to sleep isn't going to solve the problem.  Beginning to get frustrated.  Some pages render correctly, others do not.  Performance is random and degrading.  I think I'll write a review.     My final review is mixed.  A very promising device with several serious faults.",,,,,,
86,Kindle_Dx,1,M. Mears,"Although I was very happy with my Kindle DX when I received it, unfortunately the screen is now damaged due to a misguided attempt to protect it. Through Amazon's site I purchased an LCD screen protector made for the Kindle DX. The rest of the story & Amazon's response is in the following emails:     Dear Vangoddy Customer Service:  I was advised by Amazon's customer service to email you regarding the damage to my new Kindle DX while applying your LCD Screen Protector. Let me preface this by saying that I have applied screen protectors to IPods before so I am familiar with the proper way to use this product and even used latex gloves to handle the protector. I followed the instructions carefully and slowly began to apply the protector to the Kindle screen but noticed that it was not perfectly aligned so as the instructions state I began to ""lift the screen protector and reapply"". Immediately upon doing this I noticed that several large bubbles (1/4""-1/2"" in diameter) had formed on the LCD screen itself.   To prevent any further damage to the unit I slowly removed the screen protector the rest of the way but more small bubbles had formed. After removing the protector I used the cloth provided with the product and managed to work some of the large bubbles out of the LCD screen, however the damage has been done.  I ordered my Kindle DX on Sept 24, 2009 so as you can see I have owned it for only one month and the screen has been ironically ruined in my effort to protect it from damage. To say that I am profoundly disappointed in putting it mildly. Amazon customer service stated that in order to fix the screen they will charge me a $255.00 repair fee, which I cannot justify for an item that is practically new and which cost $490.00 in the first place.   I have attached 3 pictures of the screen damage. In them you will see darker spots that look like water droplets. Those are the bubbles left in the LCD screen and after several attempts to push them out they appear to be permanent.    The following email is the response from Amazon:  Please be informed that Based on your description of the issue, we can only send you another Kindle DX for $255.00 as the damage isn't covered under warranty.  The limited warranty applies only to hardware components of the Device that are not subject to accident, misuse, neglect, fire or other external causes, unauthorized use, alterations or repair, or commercial use.  Taking your concern as a feedback, I have forwarded your comments to our Kindle team. Customer feedback like yours helps us continue to improve the service we provide, and we're glad you took time to write to us. Please let us know if this e-mail resolved your question.    Well, I am still very disappointed in the response from Amazon & I warn everyone who reads this to never apply a screen protector to your Kindle. I am surprised that Amazon does not warn it's customers that the screen is not like a laptop or ipod screen & that the screen layers could separate. And although I understand that the warranty cannot cover everything, I think Amazon needs to offer more repair options to it's customers, particularly when the unit has been out of the box for only 3 weeks! I think it is unreasonable for Amazon to charge me another $255.00 for damage that is both minimal & cosmetic.         ",,,,,,
87,Kindle_Dx,3,las cosas,"Summary  I'm relatively happy.  Maybe B-.  The Kindle DX handles a wide variety of .pdf files fairly well, though there was little consistency between file type and available functions.  The big issue is that there is zero consistency in how .pdf files are displayed.  Some use all available space in both landscape and portrait mode, eliminating all margins.  This provides acceptable font sizes.  In other cases the file leaves large margins, and thus small to tiny font size.  Very unpredictable.    Background  We have owned two Kindle 1s for over a year, use it for the 5 months a year when we're out of the US and have limited access to English language books.  But much of the written material I have is in .pdf format, and while simple text converts to .txt format without problem, anything more complex is something between annoying and impossible: footnotes, multiple columns, illustrations/photos, and image files.   So I purchased the DX solely for the ability to display .pdf files, and this review will only address .pdf functions.  Both the manual and customer service provide little guidance, which is odd since this feature is surely one of the main reasons for interest in the DX.      I loaded up about 20 .pdf files.  The first set were files originally created in .pdf format, and thus not image files: large text books heavy with foot and end notes, 2 photo and 2 manga books, newsletters and magazines with complex, multi-column formatting and illustrations and documents created in Word and saved in .pdf.        The second set were image files, meaning they were either scanned or ""printed"" and saved as .pdf files.  These consisted of everything from a scanned document to a poorly scanned receipt.    Now on to the various functions and how well they worked...    1. Able to display most PDF files?  That is a quote from the manual.  What the heck does ""most"" mean?  Don't know, but everything I loaded, including poorly scanned expense receipts were displayed, and easy to read (subject to the caveat that the print size might be very small).   Periodically I received a ""some elements on this page could not be displayed"" message.   I had an entire book of book cover designs, and none of the covers (which constituted half of the book) were viewable.  But other books of illustrations and photos had none of this problem.  All graphs, illustrations, photos, manga displayed very nicely, though the display is solely black and white.  The lack of color isn't an issue for me, and the grey tones were fairly nuanced.    2. Changing type size: landscape view.  The change type font feature is not available for .pdf files.  The font size is instead automatically increased using 2 functions: cropping white margins (see paragraph 3, below) in portrait mode and expanding the width of the file by rotating the Kindle 90 degrees to landscape mode.  I created a template of font sizes in Times New Roman in a Word document with 1 inch margins, printed it and then both saved the document as a .pdf file and printed the document as .pdf (thus an image file) .  I then compared the font sizes between the printed document and both the .pdf created and .pdf image files.  In portrait mode, 16 point type (again, with 1 inch borders that disappear), shows as 12 point type.  12 point as 9.5.  In landscape, 16 shows up as 14, 12 as 10.5.   There was no difference in font size between the document created as .pdf and printed as .pdf image file.    One thing to remember about landscape mode is that it divided the page into parts.  If you have a multi-column document, you will need to advance to the next page to finish that one column, then go back a page to start the next column.  I found the page turning considerably slower than with documents on the Kindle 1.  Also, it is a dummy division of pages.  So if in landscape mode a screen is 60% of the page, then in the next page you will see 40% of the bottom of one page, some white space and then maybe 20% of the next page.  That works (somewhat) for text, but not at all for illustrations.  So you really are stuck viewing illustrations, comics, graphs, etc in portrait unless you luck out and the page is equally divisible by the landscape screen.  Sometimes it worked, other times it didn't.    Several long, complex books either took over 30 seconds to switch to landscape, or never switched.    3. White margins of PDF files are automatically cropped.  Another quote from the manual.  This is not necessarily true, particularly in landscape mode.  I had some books that retained their margins in landscape, while others lost it and the print went right to the edge.  I also had some files created as .pdf that retained their margins even in portrait.  In one dictionary, the portrait mode showed print considerably larger than landscape.  Portrait went to the edge, landscape retained the margins and indented the entire page.      4. Moving around a document.  Easy.  Menu-Go to Page-Alt and then the number.  Though why isn't it menu sensitive?  Why do I need to use Alt- with the W/2 key in order to go to page 2?  It takes 2 hands to do that.  Annoying.  But on the major plus side, the go to function goes to the page number, not the number of the document!!!  So if your book has a title page, table of contents, intro chapter with roman numerals, etc, and then page numbers, when you ""go to page 200"" it takes you to the page with that number at the bottom.  NOT the 200th page in the file.  That means you can bookmark the table of contents, and then easily go to any page with simply the ""to go page"" function.  Not surprisingly, this is not true with image files, where page 22 is the 22nd page of the file, regardless of what the page number on the actual page says.    5.  You cannot add a note or highlight text.   The manual correctly states this limitation.  The function itself simply isn't available when you have a .pdf file.    6. Bookmarks.  The bookmark function is available for all .pdf files.    7. Search.  This is the one place in the manual where a distinction is made between different types of .pdf files.  The search function is available for .pdf files, but... ""This [search] feature doesn't work in cases where a PDF document was created using image files.""  Not necessarily true.  I was unable to use the search function on several created .pdf files, but had no trouble on some image files.  That said, in general it is true that the search function works on .pdf files that are not image files.    The search of a file only works if you have open a specific file.  If you are doing a global search in all of the files on the Kindle, the manual says ""For PDFs, Kindle searches for the term in the metadata only.""  I am not an expert on adding metadata into files, but I tried, and none of the data I added showed up in a search of .pdf items.    8. Text-to-speech and dictionary functions.  Neither is addressed in the manual, but these are not available for any .pdf files.    Conclusion  Well, I finally get to view and read .pdf files on a Kindle, and I'm very thankful.  But after 2 hours of fiddling with this, my first thoughtis  that I need to buy a Kindle-pdf set of glasses much stronger than what I normally use, so that I can enlarge type that is of inadequate size.      There is little consistency between the type/size/complexity of a .pdf file and how it displays.  True Russian-roulette.  So if you don't have a fairly high tolerance for small (or smallish) type size and variable use of an already diminished set of functions, then you shouldn't buy this Kindle just for the ability to view .pdf files.  But it is at least a step in the right direction.  Though an expensive step!  ",,,,,,
88,Kindle_Dx,5,David Edmiston,"Reading on the Kindle DX is such a joy.  I've been so happy with my first generation Kindle 1, but the DX takes Kindle reading to the next level.  The amount of content that fits onto the screen is a vast improvement to the experience.  And even better than the *quantity* of content is the *quality* of the content.  The display on the DX is truly phenomenal.    I write technical documents for a living.  The product documentation that I write is full of images, diagrams, and rich formatting.  I've tried loading my PDF documents onto my Kindle 1, but they won't display.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I loaded my PDFs onto the Kindle DX. The formatting of the page displayed perfectly!!!  Zooming and rotating was simple.    I read a lot of technical documents too.  I've always been sorry that I couldn't read good technical books on my Kindle 1 (the latest Photoshop books, etc.)  They look great on the DX though.  With the DX, you can carry your whole reference library with you: dictionaries, reference manuals, the Bible, ... I even have PDF versions of the shop manuals for our dirt bikes.  I haven't loaded them onto the DX, but it sure would be easier to have them on one compact device than having five big fat books for the bikes.    The Kindle DX isn't cheap, but I imagine the price will come down eventually like it did with earlier Kindle versions.  It is an astounding device though--truly a game changing piece of equipment.  Think of how your TV viewing changed when you got your first TiVo, how driving changed when you got a GPS, how your phone changed when you got voicemail and caller ID.  That's how your reading will change when you get your fist Kindle.",,,,,,
89,Kindle_Dx,1,F. Roman,"I just lost $500 because I was waiting for a decent cover I liked for it and did not pay enough attention to protecting the screen.  I just got mine a few weeks ago, loaded some reading material and took a flight out of town, only to get tired of reading, so I put it in my purse and shoved it in the overhead compartment.  It looks like the pressure of one of the suitcases that was later put on there pressed against my purse and thereby the screen, damaging it completely.   The warranty does not cover negligence, and the replacement piece is $350.  It's not worth the price. Now I know it's not something you can take with you if you are an adventurous traveler.  Hiking or other activities that require you to pack your bags tightly.   So my advice is that if you are going to spend that much money, go the extra step and get a cover that is sturdy to resist any outside poking at the screen.  It's a cute little device, but not perfect yet. If the screen is shot they need to replace the whole thing. I think I'll just keep reading on my netbook which was the same size but with all the word processing I need, bigger memory, in color, and the size of self scanned PDF was truly adjustable to zoom.  I like my Aspire Acer One much better.  Good luck to all of you who decide to spend the extra money.",,,,,,
90,Garmin Forerunner,4,PAZMAN,"I like this thing quite a lot. I've had it for about three weeks, and have used it on 12 workouts so far.  I use it primarily for running, with biking a secondary usage.  The main reason I wanted it was for the instantaneous readout of distance, running pace and heart rate, the latter needed for the speed work I want to do this running season.      The core functionality (distance and heart rate monitoring) works perfectly.  There's none of the signal drops I've had with other heart monitors.  Once the satellites are initially acquired, I've only had one dropout when I was outside.  The initial acquisition of the satellites can be quirky and can take some time. The accuracy (according to the readout) is +/- 25ft, depending on how many satellites can be found.  I've compared the distance measurement on the GPS with a known, measured distance on one of the trails I run on (the Chicago lakefront path).  The GPS always increments a mile when I'm within 5 or 10 feet of the mile marker sign on the path.  Well, I guess that's the least I should expect from a $350 GPS unit! Of course it's bigger than a normal running stopwatch, but that hasn't bothered me at all.  The heart rate strap is also very comfortable and well-designed.    The display is crisp and has one outstanding feature: The information presented on the various pages can be completely user-customized.  The default screen layout is rather poor, but in just a few steps I could replace it with the information I wanted to see while I run.  There are almost 40 different data fields you can choose from for display. Examples: current pace, average lap pace, average run pace, heartrate, distance.    The only disappointment is the point-in-time (instantaneous) pace measurement: It varies wildly during a run.  I see swings as big as +/-  3 minutes/mile.  I'm a marathoner and I know my pace is fairly consistent during a run.  I just looked at my run today, and according to the data the first mile varied from 5:57/mile to 12:06 mile. I suspect the problem is either in the averaging algorithm (too short a distance?), or in the uncertainty that results from different satellites coming in and out of view.  The variations seem to get worse under tree cover compared with an open area.  Luckily there's a lap-average pace that can be presented, and at least that value is useful and more accurate.  The bottom line is that you can't look at the watch and say ""right now I'm running 9 mins/mile"". There is the ability to specify a pace smoothing factor, but I have it maxed out and still see the variations.  The elevation readout also seems inaccurate, but that isn't important to me.      Upload of workout data to the PC software (Training Center) is transparent.  The PC software is very good for presenting time/distance/pace/heartrate/calorie data.  However the maps it shows are very crude.  I've worked a bit with one of the online, subscription services (MotionBased).  That looks really good and provides some additional functionality beyond the included Training Center software, although I still haven't decided if it's worth the $$$ yet for long-term data storage.  MotionBased allows export to Google Earth, and it's tremendously cool to see your running path superimposed on a satellite image.  You can recharge the unit through the USB port on your computer, although it's slower than using the dedicated recharger.     I had hoped that owning this device would prove motivational for me, and indeed it has.  I can't imagine running or biking without it. Updating my training log is trivial now: Plug this thing into my computer, and it's done.  My hope is that a future software update will do something about the pace calculation (maybe a few additional levels of smoothing?).  If so, the Forerunner 305 would earn 5 stars+++.      Positives:    Flawless heart rate sampling   Great distance measuring and lap-average pace calculation  Seamless integration with a PC  Fully-automatic training log update  User-customizable display      Negatives;    Wildly-varying pace readout.  ",,,,,,
91,Garmin Forerunner,1,Slow Runner,"Here is what I wrote in Dec 2008:    I waited to get one of these training devices due to high price and concerns that the data would not be reliable.    I can say after using the 305 that the data is very reliable and the price drop makes this an incredibly valuable training tool for the following reasons:    1) Removes the subjective evaluation of running--today ""felt great"" is no longer useful--the bpm tells the story. Even a slow run can be a great workout on an objective bpm basis.    2) The data collection is seemless--you don't notice wearing the watch although it is rather large.    3) Motivation--knowing exactly where you are at both w/bpm and pace allows you to slow down even if you subjectively think you are going slow, or speed up if you are in fact going too slow.    4) Historical record--imagine having your PR in a marathon recorded on this thing, or even better several months of the build up to such a PR, I wish I had the record of that but hopefully will in the future.    Possible downsides:    1) I don't know how long the device will last.    2) GPS coverage may vary over time/location--so far it has acquired the satellites quickly.    In total this an outstanding training tool that can help any runner. I think the negative reviews may be due to either (1) a bad device, or (2) olympic caliber athletes that need greater moment by moment precision. I haven't had any problems w/the 305.    ----    Well today I have to go with just one star.  Turns out I unknowingly had one of those defective devices.    I found out when I ran a marathon and the watch appeared to work but a software glitch on the watch cut out all the data from about mile 13 on (even on other programs such as sporttracks).  The watch totals were correct and gave me no indication that the data was spoiled by a defective device.    Now that problem alone is manageable.  A latent defect in the watch.  But Garmin customer support argued w/me for 30 minutes that it was me that was at fault.  The reality was that it wasn't user error.  Looking at these other reviews I am surprised that Garmin allows their customer service to take such a hostile attitude to the apparently minor incidence of defective watches.  Then again, who knows how many times they resell these defective units hoping the person doesn't log long runs.      The funny part, customer service suggested that I reset the watch and then go for a 26 mile drive.  The willingness of their customer service to suggest such an absurd comparison is tellling.  It is absurd on at least two levels.  First, driving 26 miles likely takes 1/3 or less the time.  This may hit at a defect well known to Garmin.  Why not just fix the defect in the watch instead of trying to trick you? (...the next Marathon where the same watch cuts out, what then?  does customer service suggest a hard reset and that I go out and run another Marathon?)  The second absurdity is that a customer should invest the time and money to test the quality of a clearly defective product.  How about I send it in and you reset it and cover 26 miles in over 3 hours and then let me know the result?    So the customer service is really a huge negative on an otherwise cool product.  I'll be looking for other brands to replace this watch.",,,,,,
92,Garmin Forerunner,1,Brad,"I am not Dr Mark.  I signed in under my ID and for some reason it is listing this as from Dr. Mark.  I don't have time to figure it out, so sorry Dr. Mark - I'm not trying to assume your moniker.    I have owned the Garmin Forerunner 305 for just over a month.  I am trying to get back into shape after years of being sedentary and my trainer wanted me to get a heart rate monitor.  Despite the fact that there are several good and functional monitors well under $100, as a gadget freak the Forerunner was very attractive.    First, the thing is big.  I guess it has to be to fit in the electronics, but I am actually a little self concious wearing it because it is so big that it looks a little pretentious - maybe in a year when I'm buff I won't mind.    Next, the screen, despite its size, is difficult to read in both sunlight and low light. I find myself having to almost stop my activity to hold it in the exact position where I can read it.  That simply isn't compatible with a good workout.    While I freely admit that I'm no rocket scientist, I am a pretty good gadget freak, and I still have to refer to the manual for some features.  It is not very intuitive to navigate for me.    Lastly, the thing takes too long to acquire satellites when you start it up.  When I'm ready to go - I'm ready to go.  Under the best conditions I have to wait a couple of minutes for it to acquire the satellites.  Since it won't let you go to other screens until the satellites are acquired, you can't set the timer, so you either wait for it - or start your activity - and then have to stop to set the timer because it is difficult to see the screen and reset it while moving.  The time to acquire satellites is especially frustrating when traveling.  One of the things that attracted me to the gadget was that I could ""capture"" the track of my outings when traveling.  As a practical matter, unless I want to go to the parking lot and boot it up 10 minutes in advance, it misses the first 10 or so minutes of my outing while it acquires the satellites.  Then I have to stop my activity so that I can see the screen to reset it - you get the picture.    I own a Garmin Nuvi, and love it, so I know they know how to get it right.  While the idea is cool and maybe one day they will figure it out, this thing is not ready for prime time yet and I regret the purchase.  I'm going to just purchase a cheap polar and throw this thing in my box of worthless gadgets to donate to a museum some day.",,,,,,
93,Logitech,5,~Z~,"Installation was a breeze, it took less than 3 minutes to install. I am using it in a Windows 7 OS environment. Unlike most webcam installations, this one was up and running in no time. It has a user-friendly and a very easy to navigate interface/menu. High Definition is pretty much the norm for resolution qualities now-a-days. The Logitech C910 I consider is the ""high-end"" webcam for the average user. The webacm sits on my 23 widescreen monitor, it balances perfectly on my monitor even though it does not have a clip. However, this might not work so well with laptops.It takes crystal clear snapshots using 10 mega pixels (software enhanced), not even my digital camera is that high in mega pixels. The webcam is not as high quality using it on video chat (HD 720p), but it still beats the other webcam I was using before. I really don't think I will be using the video recorder feature often since I really can't see a need to record myself sitting in front of my desktop but I decided to try it anyways. When I tested the picture quality recording a video, it was clear (HD 1080p) and the sound was superb. Check out the attached video review for yourself (please disregard my Spanglish accent). The videos are saved in .wmv format. The widescreen lens allows a wider camera view compared to the average ""square box"" - so much more fits in the camera's view. The LightRight 2 technology automatically adjust the lighting conditions in the camera's view, no need to be fusing around with the settings. It offers a 60-day trial of Logitech FastAccess facial recognition software. You can subscribe for this service that offers facial recognition to access Internet banking, email, etc without the hassle of remembering all your passwords. It can also lock your system to avoid use from unauthorized individuals.Another awesome fun feature is the Logitech Video Effects. You can use Avatars that will follow your movements and mimic your speech as you chat with your friends. Add face accessories and masks to snapshots or video chat. Distort you image by adding visual video affects like stretching your face, big buggy eyes or distorting the color. There are tons of features to choose from and you can even download additional avatars and accessories direct from Logitech free of charge. The webcam even offers a motion sensor feature that you can set up to record with a date and time stamp when there is any movement in front of the camera. Overall great webcam. Major improvement to the Logitech QuickCam Pro I was using before. The Logitech Quickcam Pro offered most of the features listed on the C910, but now I have HD widescreen quality with vivid colors and superb resolution.",,,,,,
94,Logitech,5,David C. Wallace,"The primary point is that this camera is not Skype certified, but performs better than a skype certified camera. This camera DOES DO 720p in Skype at 30FPS as opposed to the flagship certified Skype camera which does only 22FPS. This camera has great video and audio for a webcam. It does 720p in skype, Windows Live Messenger BETA, and Logitech Vid HD. I was reluctant to buy another HD webcam after the disappointment of both the Microsoft Lifecam Cinema HD and the FaceVsion Touchcam N1. But this is the first HD camera that feels like it",,,,,,
95,Logitech,5,Rebecca Haden,"We tried out the Logitech HD Pro Webcam C910 and we love it. The picture quality is not quite as good as that of our Nikon video camera, and the photo editing software is not as good as the standalone program we bought -- but that's not a flaw in the camera or its software. That's comparing it with different kinds of products. For video chat, it's perfect, and as you can see from this video review, it does a very good job of creating videos. Check out an example of an edited video here: [...] We did this entirely with the webcam, edited it and uploaded it to YouTube, and embedded it into our web page. We never had to look at the documentation or help, either -- it was incredibly easy. It took just about an hour, counting opening the boxes, installing the cameras, deciding on a topic for our experimental video, shooting it, editing it, and getting it onto the web page. In later uses, we've found that some situations require an additional microphone, and we've gone back to iMovie for most of our editing, but we're using the camera regularly for video filming and for video chat. I can say with confidence that it is possible to use this camera right out of the box with no additional hardware, software, or training, and to get good results.",,,,,,
96,Logitech,5,THATCH,"Review update-- 9/11/10    During my original review, I rated the camera with regards to Skype use. I'm elated to learn from a Logitech forum post that this camera will be supporting Skype HQ with release of Skype 5.0! Because of this great news, I have revamped my review to better reflect the camera's use with 5.0, which I have been testing in beta.     The positives:    Camera & software install is easy  Camera Size is small  Design is attractive  Logitech HD video chat software is a nice option for those who aren't big into Skype or other big name branded chat programs.  It does great in low light situations and with dual mics seems overall very capable of capturing small sounds  Even in HD, this cam doesn't seem to drag on my system resources and make the PC slow like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00359F1G6"">Microsoft LifeCam Cinema</a>    Negatives:    Not yet Skype HQ compliant, but will be soon with the release of Skype 5.0!

97,Logitech,5,Qrysta White,"Hello I purchased the camera to use with Skype mainly.  Yes on a Mac there is no Logitech software whatsoever so its plug and play.    I'm thrilled.  In little more than the monitor's lighting the image was good, with more lighting it was as good as it is on a still with a 7.1mp camera. I swooshed about and the image didn't blur sickeningly.  The Follow your Head feature, well you don't get that or any other manually selectable attribute because of the no-software punishment we mac-ies are still enduring in this day and age.  If Logitech doesn't care to give us software I'm perfectly happy with some other creator doing so.    Mic functions even when you are not using the imaging element under USB Unknown Audio Input and in some software it self selected.  It isn't good enough for intense talking-to- software like Rosetta Stone which is listening for pitch and precise pronunciation.  Maybe if you hold it close to your mouth it would work well enough even for that application but you don't want to be holding a camera as you'll smudge and eventually scratch the lens by handling it.  If you can find a way to mount closer to your face but keep your hands off it, then you can solve that little problem as well.    I used it as a true video movie maker using Quicktime Pro 7.  Just chose NEW MOVIE, let the software configure the BEST settings and clicked RECORD!  19 SECONDS IS 2.6mb and the file I created opens and plays as it should in every mov file player I have.    note:  In Quicktime v10 you have to choose the HIGH setting.  Camera doesn't function at all in the MAXIMUM setting.    What you can't do with this camera is use it stealthily as a security cam as it emits a lovely BLUE GLOW in the shape of a PARENTHESIS framing the lens.  The blue band you see in the ad literature is a LIGHT and I don't think they make that very clear in any documentation.  I thought it was just a painted stripe.  When it lit up I was surprised!  In the dark a thief would see that glow from across any room.    What takes a bit of getting used to (and I'd guess that is with any camera) is that you have to turn left when you mean right and right when you want to move left or to refer to that side of your body or the image and your things behind you.

100,Apple_Tv,5,Just Another Geek,"I am not an Apple Afficianodo.  I don't wear jeans and black turtlenecks in reverence to Steve Jobs.  I don't hang out at the Apple Store and covet becoming a ""genius""; however, I have to give credit where credit is due. The last few products Apple has brought out - the iPod, iPhone, iPad  - have been incredible and changed the consumer electronics and media / software landscape.  Apple TV is now positioned to do the same, but it will take some more time to fully realize the potential of this device.    Apple TV effectively allows you to stream whatever is on your iTunes to your TV and home theater system.  Moreover, it has built in support for Netflix, You Tube and a few other internet based media content providers.  The picture quality and performance for these services are worth the price of admission.  There is significant potential to advance the platform - just give it some time.    System Overview: My Apple TV is plugged into a 60 inch Samsung 1080p LED HDTV via HDMI (video) and a Yamaha Home Theater Receiver via Toslink optical cable (audio).  I have AT&T Uverse with their 802.11g Residential Gateway (combination of DSL modem and wireless router) with their Elite DSL service (6 MB per second).  iTunes runs on a Dell Desktop with 4GB of memory, Intel Core 2 Duo processor and 500 GB Hard Drive operating on Windows Vista (64 bit) and secured with Norton 360 (firewall, antivirus, etc.).  The network handles the Desktop, 2 iPhones, a Blackberry, an iPad, the Apple TV, 4 Laptops, a wireless Printer and a networked wired printer.  The Computer / Residential Gateway are in the Den and the TV / Home Theater / Apple TV are in the family room.  The two rooms are about 100 feet apart and are separated by five walls.    Set Up:  Easy as pie.  It took five minutes to plug in the HDMI cable, the optical cable, the power outlet and then adding it to the wireless network.  Sharing iTunes from my desktop to Apple TV took another 20 minutes, since I had to download the new version of iTunes and restart my computer and Apple TV. Apple really makes it easy - I didn't have to make any adjustments to my firewall settings to share iTunes on the desktop with Apple TV.  I also downloaded the Apple Remote on my iPhone and iPad, which took another 5 minutes.    User Interface: Apple's secret sauce is the simplicity of their products.  Apple TV is no different.  The menu is very simple - Movies, TV, Internet, Computer and Settings.  Movies and TV are for renting content directly from iTunes within Apple TV.  Internet gives you access to Netflix, You Tube, etc.  Computer gives you access to iTunes on your computer.  Settings allows you to change the various Apple TV options.  The remote control is Apple's usual model of minimalist efficiency, with a menu button, a play / pause button and an iPod like controller.  The supplied remote works well with Apple TV, but is a bit cumbersome when one has to enter data (e.g., e-mail addresses, search on YouTube or Netflix).  A much better solution is downloading Apple Remote on your iPhone or iPad.  It basically turns the iPhone or iPad into a big touch pad that allows you to use gestures to control the Apple TV (e.g., swipe left, swipe right, double click, etc.).  Moreover, it automatically provides a keyboard when one is asked for text input (e.g., for search).  Apple remote is free on the App Store.    Netflix Streaming / Video Quality:  Setting up Netflix was quick - basically just enter your e-mail address / password and you're ready to go.  I watched some TV from BBC, a foreign flick and Iron Man.  Each program loaded quickly - less than 30 seconds.  Picture quality was good to great, depending on the source material.  Picture quality was comparable to DVD for SD material(perhaps slightly better), but slightly less sharp than upconverted DVD or blue-ray. HD Programming looked like the HD on-demand programming through uVerse. There was enough of a buffer that there was no jittering, pixelation or stuttering on the streaming to the TV.  Sound quality on the stream was good - I don't think they stream in 5.1, so the video stream doesn't leverage the subwoofer.  Considering that I'm running a heavily taxed wireless system on 802.11g with a 100 foot distance between Apple TV and the Gateway, the picture quality and streaming performance are impressive.  Having this quality of Netflix compatibility is worth the price of admission by itself.    iTunes Streaming: I streamed some music from my Playlists from the Computer.  Sound quality is good, but not great.  My Yamaha CD Player sounds better, but it can only hold 5 cds.  Having access to my entire library is very useful, so you lose sound quality but gain convenience. iTunes streams not only the music, but also the cover art.  After a few minutes, Apple TV switches into screensaver mode and starts transmitting pictures to the TV along with the music. I also streamed some videos from my computer and the streaming was again flawless.  One of the issues with Apple TV is that it only supports the Apple video standards, i.e., MP4.  I had some DIVX files that I converted over to MP4 by using DVD Fab and imported them into iTunes.  So if you have a library of AVI, Divx, Xvid, etc., this will require conversion of those files in order to stream from your computer.    iTunes from within Apple TV: There is access to an iTunes store within Apple TV as well.  They have a different pricing structure, in that TV shows and movies are available for rent only.  They have a limited number of titles at this point - primarily BBC, ABC (since Steve Jobs sits on their Board) and Fox.  CBS and NBC are not on Apple TV.  Movie selection is decent - they have all the latest movies.  The Apple TV selection can be easily increased by just downloading the content you want from iTunes on your desktop and then streaming it to Apple TV.     YouTube Streaming: Surprisingly good.  The HQ / HD You Tube pieces look remarkably crisp on the TV. The older content that was meant to watch on a small window on your computer looked a little pixelated, but acceptable.    Apple has built a great platform with a lot of potential.  With what is available right now - Apple TV is a pretty impressive value at $99.  It is worth it just for the Netflix streaming and integration with iTunes.  Since Apple TV is actually built on the same hardware (at least the processing chip) as the iPhone and iPad and has the same operating system, I wouldn't be surprised if there are ""apps"" that will eventually make it to Apple TV to further enhance Apple TV (e.g., ABC Streaming, Games, Amazon on Demand, etc.).  There is supposed to be an upgrade to the operating system with a new version of Airplay that comes out in November, 2010.  This will allow you to stream from an iPad or iPod to the Apple TV as well.    I looked at other streaming devices (e.g., Roku, using my Panasonic Blue Ray for Netflix, etc.) and none of them had the simplicity and reliabilty that the Apple TV offers.  The Wi Fi ""stick"" for my Blue Ray player is $80 anyway and the Netflix integration isn't anywhere nearly as robust as Apple TV.  UVerse also has music and picture streaming built in using Microsoft Media Center - however, it required some network configuration and it crashes quite often.  I didn't purchase a Roku, but a friend of mine has had a number of issues with streaming performance.  At under $100, the Apple TV is competitively priced with other streaming options.  Now just bring on the ""apps"".             ",,,,,,
101,Apple_Tv,4,S. Miller,"I was looking forward to this product since it was announced early last month.  I'm glad I pulled the trigger and bought it when it became available.  For $99 it provides most of the functionality I was paying microsoft $50 a year for.  I've become less dependent on the XBOX as a game machine, and more as a Netflix/Media Streamer since my family has grown, and not having to pay for XBOX Live was one of the driving reasons behind this purchase.  The reason I say ""most of the functionality"" is due to it not having the codec support that the XBOX360 comes with out of the box.  I've had no issues with playback of mp4 or m4v files, and I'm happy with that, but it lacks support for WMV and AVI (as far as I've experienced).  This isn't exactly a deal breaker since I can re-encode any content to supported codecs with handbrake and use iTunes to take care of my video library.      The UI is slick, the setup was somewhat easy (but would have been easier with keyboard support) and the ability to control music from my laptop and desktop is fantastic (through iTunes via the currently limited ""airplay"" functionality).      I'm really happy with the YouTube, Flickr and Netflix support.  They are by far the best I've seen from a media center, but I can see certain aspects being a pain if you use the included remote (there is no keyboard to speak of, and scrolling through letter to spell things out is a hassle).   The remote app on iOS devices more than makes up for the lack of a keyboard since it provides added functionality (such as alpha numeric input, quick seeking and library browsing).  I look forward to video support with airplay and will update this review once I get to play with that (in November?).      One last thing - it's quiet.  The thing barely makes a peep.",,,,,,
102,Apple_Tv,3,ShutterBug,"PROS  *Low Power (less than 6 watts)  *Compact  *Good-looking UI  *Netflix support (unlike previous generation AppleTV)  *Remote App for iPad/iPhone/iPod touch  *Airplay (though basically we just have Airtunes functionality until iOS 4.2 comes out for iPad/iPhone/iPod touch).  *Closed Captions (Content dependent)    CONS  *Lots of ""Loading..."" screens  *No Local Storage! (must stream over Internet or via iTunes on PC/Mac using Home Sharing.  I know you were trying to cut costs Apple, but why not at least allow local USB storage?  I know, I know: DRM.)  *IR Sensor inferior to previous generation AppleTV (requires more direct line of sight)  *Lag before videos and podcasts start playing (even when located on a local computer)  *Netflix controls are not as good as Roku.  Infrequent keyframes makes it hard to rewind to an exact spot.  Roku does much better (and even PS3 Netflix controls are better).  *Podcast controls sometimes get confused (screen indicates reversing at maximum speed, but video is actually reversing at 1x)  *Doesn't precache artwork icons (Scrolling down through a list of podcasts or Netflix movies, it loads the screen with empty icons then slowly downloads them.  This happens no matter how long you wait before scrolling down.  Sometimes, it never gets around to downloading certain icons.  Hey Apple, how about displaying the name of the movie while you are retrieving the artwork so we can start using the interface even if all of the artwork isn't there?)  [Update: there may be some precaching going on, but just not in a very intelligent manner.  I have about 170 movies in my Netflix instant queue and a 1.5 Mbps DSL connection so that may contribute to the slowness displaying artwork.  If you have a very fast internet connection, you will probably have minimal delay.]  *No Pandora  *No App support (Yet?  Come on Apple, enable App support.  It won't take long before we have lots of useful 3rd party apps.  I'm sure Pandora would be one of the first and then NPR and local weather forecast.)  *No 1080p - 720P only (Yes, most people don't have the bandwidth to support 1080p streaming over the internet, but someday we will.  Also, it would be nice to be able to show your 1080p video you shot with your new camcorder or high-end DSLR.)  *Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews are not available for Netflix movies.  *Remote app could display the actual menus for faster selections.  *Home Sharing must be activated for a specific single account.  (Result: If both you and your spouse have an iTunes account you will have to choose one or the other and will only have access to media in that person's iTunes account.)    UPDATE:  Removed from Cons:  ""*Can't add internet radio stations to a favorites list (and there are hundreds if not thousands to scroll through).""  Someone commented that you can add a radio station to your favorites by holding the center button down.  I tried this and it works.  Not sure how you're supposed to know this as it's not mentioned in the brief instruction book.",,,,,,
103,Apple_Tv,1,Martin Anderson,"I purchased the latest generation Apple TV to playback movies that I have stored on a NAS device (via iTunes) and to watch movies using Netflix's streaming service.  In the past, I've used an older generation Apple TV and an Xbox360 to do the exact same thing, and the videos have always played back flawlessly.    I've given the Apple TV one star because it has problems playing back video files from iTunes and it has problems playing Netflix movies as well.    Movies from iTunes    When playing back videos that I have in iTunes, the unit drops video frames, making the video appear jerky.  The problem isn't in the video files:  When I play the same videos back on my PC or using my Xbox360, they look fine.  Plus, when I see jerky video, I can even backup the video a few seconds, and the second time I watch the same scene, it ISN'T jerky.    And the problem isn't in my network, either.  I use a wired gigabit network.  The Apple TV shows when the video is downloaded fully from the network to Apple TVs internal RAM, and the problem occurs even after the movie has been fully downloaded from iTunes to the Apple TV.  Plus, I can still watch the same movies on my Xbox360 and my older generation Apple TV without the jerky playback problem.    And the problem isn't a defective Apple TV, either:  I've already exchanged it once, and the same problem happens with the second unit.    There's either a glitch in the firmware or the processor just can't handle video playback and whatever else is going on at the same moment, and that problem was not present on last generation's Apple TV.    I'm not the only person who has noticed this problem, either.  Google ""dropped frames on new apple tv"" or ""minor video stutter"" and you'll see an ongoing thread about the problem on Apple's support forums.    I realize that a lot of the reviews fault the new Apple TV for not having an internal hard drive.  This really doesn't bother me.  The older Apple TV units (with hard drives) were much more expensive, ran hot, and resulted in some hard drive noise.  The latest generation unit is much cheaper, runs cool, and makes absolutely no noise.  My only complaint is that the video is choppy when playing back movies.      Movies from Netflix    After watching several movies using Netflix, I've noticed a consistent problem with the audio.  In the middle of a movie, the video will go black for a second, and when it returns, the audio will be gone.  The only way to fix the problem is stop the movie, exit Netflix, and go back in, and restart the movie.  This has now happened to me at least 3 times.    I've also watched numerous movies with my Xbox360 with no problems.    Hopefully, both of these problems are firmware bugs that can be resolved with a firmware update.  Hopefully, Apple will fix them.  Until then, I'm going to look for something else.",,,,,,
104,Apple_Tv,5,JohnRN,"I must say this little black box is just stupendous!!!  This is my first Apple TV, I had always been hesitant about them but decided at $99 now with Netflix streaming I just couldn't pass it up.  Setup was a breeze, it was so easy to learn, really didn't have to learn it having used other Apple products it was easy to figure out fast.      The picture quality in Netflix was really nice. There was no stuttering of the stream, the audio was just fine.  I found the menu really nice.  I was able to browse for new movies, rate films seen, add films to my instant que, and it gave me suggestions as well.  VERY FUNCTIONAL.      There were quite a few free TV shows such as Grey's Anatomy and Desperate Housewives (ABC shows) in addition to the $0.99 ones.      Browsing my movies on my Mac Mini media server was just a breeze.  Connected it too my iTunes account, it instantly found my iTunes and thus all my media.  Movies played quickly and at standard def. they looked just as good as they always have.      I have not tried any HD videos on it yet so I can't comment on that.      For those that are concerned about storage capacity etc, it has 8GB of Samsung flash memory storage per the tear down by iFixit, as well as 256MB of RAM, the A4 used is the same as in the iPad.  It was also found that it runs iOS, it has been jailbroken but it is not yet available to the public.  It is also capable of decoding 1080p content, so there is hope for that for those of you who are concerned with that.",,,,,,
105,Apple_Tv,1,A. Clark,"I was very excited to receive my Apple TV.  Here are the pros and cons.    PROs:  1. Black color; matches TV and DVR  2. Extremely small; barely notice it  3. Setup was about as dummy-proof as possible  4. Photos function is really cool  5. Music streaming from laptop works well      CONs:  1. Text input needs re-design; frustratingly slow entering letters  2. I have download speeds of 15 mbps...Apple recommends anything over 6 mbps.  We sat down and rented Cyrus last night at 6:30 pm.  We went to bed at midnight and were only able to watch 20 minutes of it, due to buffering and downloading.    3. Tried watching a movie from my macbook through Apple TV and we could watch about 30 minutes and then it would need to buffer for 30 minutes, stir and repeat.  Needless to say, it took 4 hours to watch a 2 hour movie.      I have examined every possible aspect for why it is taking so long for renting/downloading movies.  It is absolutely ridiculous...I mean, who gets up in the morning and says ""I need to go on Apple TV to rent that movie we want to watch tomorrow night.""  Just crazy.      I would not recommend this product at all.    Have already returned it.  Thinking of trying ROKU.",,,,,,
106,Canon,5,Michael Sandman,"If you're looking for a pocketable camera that has reasonably high quality images, lets you control aperture, speed and focus and shoot in RAW format, this is it.  I bought mine as an upgrade from a previous small but versatile camera, a Canon Powershot S70.      The Powershot S95 was introduced in August 2010 as a slight upgrade to the S90, which was widely praised for its image quality and excellent interface but criticized for being hard to hold (""like a bar of soap in the shower"") and for having a control dial that turned too easily.  The S95 fixes both problems and adds a couple of other features in a package that fits in the pocket of your jeans (if they're not super tight).  The case is metal, and although there are no finger grips on the body, it's not slippery at all.  It feels like it's covered with super-fine sandpaper (like 1000 or 1500 grit, for those you who know what that feels like).     The second major complaint about the S-90 was that the function selection ring on the rear moved too easily. The ring on the S-95 has a slight click when you move it, and it doesn't move unless you want it to.     There are a couple of other cameras of this type, including the Panasonic LX-3 and LX-5 and the Samsung TL500.  They all have let you control camera functions, and like the S95 they have 10 MP sensors that are almost twice as large as a typical pocket camera, so the pixels on the sensor are larger.   That lets them gather light more efficiently, which reduces digital ""noise"" when you shoot in dim light.  Image quality is noticeably better than photos from typical pocket cameras.  You can make an 8 x 10 or perhaps 11x14 enlargement, although a digital SLR will be significantly better for larger prints.  They also have f/2.0 lenses at their widest angle, although the aperture closes down as you zoom in.     The Canon has two advantages over the Panasonic LX-3 & LX-5.  First, you really can put it in your pocket or in a belt case no bigger than the one you use for a mobile phone.  Second, the interface is a brilliant re-thinking of how a very small camera with a full set of controls should work.  There's not much room for buttons on the small surface, but you don't have to get into a multi-level menu on the LCD, and yet changing settings is fast and intuitive.    For example, there's a ring around the lens that you can grip easily to control zoom, or, shutter speed, or aperture, change ISO, or manually focus.  You select what you want it to do by pressing a button on the top, and when you look at the LCD screen you can see what it's programmed for.  There's a selection wheel on the back for other functions, and when you move it, a clear set of choices appears on the screen. The selections are context-appropriate, so they change depending on whether you've set the camera for aperture control, ""Program"" control, etc.     The two Panasonics have the same sensor as their Canon equivalents, but they offer a slightly wider lens (24mm vs. 28 for the S95).  The LX-3 has a much shorter telephoto - only 60 mm.  The LX-5, which was introduced a couple of weeks before the S95, has a 90mm telephoto, and you can buy an add-on optical viewfinder.  It also has a flash shoe in addition to the pop-up flash, although you can buy a dedicated add-on flash for the S-95 to supplement its pop-up flash  The LX-5 is about 25% more expensive than the Canon S95 (and 60% more with the optional viewfinder) and while it would fit in a coat pocket, you can't stuff it into a trouser pocket.       If you want a truly pocketable camera that gives you good image quality and full control over your photography, the S95 is an excellent choice.    ",,,,,,
107,Canon,5,Amazon Fan for Many Years,"I spent two or three months doing tons of research to replace my old Canon SD870. Finally a month ago I decided to buy the S90 despite the fact that it didn't have 720 HD video, it was a one-year old model, and many reviewers disliked the looseness of the control dial. My S90 arrived in the middle of August and over the course of many days I learned how to use all the functions and was very pleased with the results.    And then on August 19 Canon announced the upcoming release of the Canon S95. I immediately returned my S90 and anxiously awaited the arrival of its successor. Earlier today it was delivered and I've been using it all day.    I must say that I wanted to love the S90, but the smoothness of the body annoyed me. I figured I'd just have to get used to the slipperiness. But now that I have the S95 in my hands, I can't believe what a difference the matte finish makes regarding secure handling. There's no way you can appreciate the difference if you haven't handled both models yourself. Honestly, that feature alone is worth the slightly higher price.    Control dial issues? No longer! Subtle click-stops have solved that problem.    Finger missing the shutter button on the S90? Well, the geniuses at Canon took care of that, also. You won't mistake the shutter button on the S95 for any other button due to the distinct and secure feel.    I'm in love with this camera. I won't go into details about picture quality because it's as good as its predecessor; there are examples all over the Internet. And of course the S95's 720 HD video is a big improvement over the standard video of the S90.    Only one ""con"" I can think of: The new, smooth, elegant display on the back is no longer recessed therefore you'll have to be careful if you place the camera face up on a flat surface. In that position it appears the screen will come in direct contact with the table's surface.",,,,,,
108,Canon,3,GS,"This is my 5th Canon (G2, S30, A530, XSi) and is supposedly Canon's best ever P&S.  I bought this for its compactness, low light performance, and image quality.  In these regards I would say it is excellent!  But for its price I would expect something that is top of the line on most aspect which I found out not true.    What I don't like and wish the Canon Guy take note (most serious come first):    1. Most people complained about the flash design which is true and very very annoying.  I have gone through 2 trips and 3000 photos. I still get surprised whenever the flash turns active and push my left index finger out.  The camera has safeguard measure so that whenever it detects that the flash movement is blocked it will stop and issue a warning signal.  The only way to reset it is to switch the camera OFF and then ON again.  I have gone through this procedure around 10 times a day during my trips. Because of this I expect the first thing to fail for my S95 would be the flash. And I would not expect it to last as long as my G2 (9 years and still going strong). CANON GUY, PLEASE MAKE THE CAMERA A LITTLE TALLER AND PUT THE FLASH FIXED IN YOUR NEXT VERSION !!!    2. The internal micro-processor is too slow and the firmware design cannot handle real time event.  In layman terms, S95 responded too slow in every aspect.  One example is after I finished a shot and then quickly turn the front wheel to change exposure compensation and prepare taking another shot, I found out the camera did not respond to my front wheel adjustment at all.  It had to wait until it finished rounding up the previous job (and it took a while to finish!) before it has time to register any change on the wheels and buttons.  So if you acted too soon it will totally disregard it.  The killing part is the processing usually take long. So beware user: don't think you can shoot like a professional fast and quick between photos, you have to pace yourself and make sure u don't press buttons and adjust wheels too fast. CANON FIRMWARE GUYS: PLEASE SET UP AN EVENT QUEUE AND USE INTERRUPT TRIGGER TO RECORD ALL USER'S INPUT, SO THAT THEY CAN BE PROCESSED LATER, MY PANASONIC ELECTRONIC RICE COOKER DO A BETTER JOB THAN S95 IN THIS REGARD!!!     3. This one is the deal breaker.  It cannot auto focus during video recording!  This make the video feature seriously handicapped. Althought S95 has small lens and a deep depth of field, you still find the video constantly out of focus when your kids are running around you while u r shooting them. I thought I would have spent $400 and get something that can at least do good photos and video.  Well, it can only do half of it and I guess I have to wait for something better in the near future.  Just for reference my $100 Samsung can autofocus during video recording!!!    4. WB and some other adjustments not allowed to work in most SCN modes, which make the SCN shooting modes seriously handicapped.     5. My favorite Stitch Assist Mode (for taking panoramic-view picture) works only in landscape, not portrait mode.      6. The rear dial is much improved over the S90 (not as loose) but still easy to turn by mistake.  I have many occasions of changing the ISO from AUTO to 3200 by mistake.  When I find out it is already too late and I got a dozen grainy photos!    7. Battery last only 100-150 photos in practical use and so need at least 2 batteries for a day's photo.  If you are doing video, expect to bring half a dozen !!!    8. The image stabilization (IS) is not very effective.  I closely examined the LCD screen images when IS is both engaged and not engaged.  The difference is very subtle and nothing compared with Rebel XSi (SLR) in which the image motion is obviously smooth out and slowed down.  The salesperson told me don't expect any serious IS capability from P&S' I wonder if that's true.    9. The lens is fast (F2.0) at wide end only.  But at zoom end it is very slow (F4.9).  My G2 has F2-F2.5 throughout the whole zoom range.  I can understand it's a limitation imposed by the size of the lens, not Canon's fault.  Coupled with an ineffective IS, I got a lot of blurry pictures at max zoom under cloudy sky outdoor.  I have very steady hands and I hold my breath when I press shutter, and my wife could do much worse. I wish Canon would put a better but little bigger lens in the next version. F2.0-3.5 would be a good compromize.        In summary, you would think the S95 is wonderful when you play with it shortly at Best Buy.  The picture quality and LCD's display quality are superb too. But when you bought it home and put it to use in real life, you will find out a lot more to be wanted and that it's too far from being perfect at all.  Some shortcomings like the video focusing are in my opinion a design fault, others are inconvenience and annoyance.  The Canon Guys should have done much more than just a touch-up of S90.  I waited a long time and paid $400 for a camera like S95 and thought this would be the ultimate pocket P&S that will last me a long long time. Well definitely it is not simply for reason like the half-cooked video recording capability.  FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY, ALTHOUGH WITH ALL THOSE SHORTCOMINGS, IT IS STILL THE BEST POCKET P&S ON MARKET, NO OTHER BETTER CHOICE YET.    In my opinion Canon still makes the best digital P&S and I might stay a Canon buyer in the future.  But my advise to Canon is to stop abusing loyalty of fans like me.  And make products that really live up to its name.  For those who already got a decent P&S, I would recommend hold your purchase until S99, S100 or whatever which at least solve the flash and video fault.    ",,,,,,
109,Canon,5,Surfseventy8,"When I first saw the S90, I was quite intrigued by the amazing low light performance.  As a dSLR shooter, I've become quite used to shooting at ISO 800 and above with virtually no noise.  I hate the look of photos taken with tiny, on-camera flashes.  They are very unflattering so I try to shoot with natural light as much as possible.  I've had a few older, basic point and shoots and eventually moved up to the G9 but they all had the same issue: tons of noise on any photo shot above ISO 200.  With the larger sensor size faster f/2.0 lens and advanced in-camera noise reduction processing, this seems to do just fine at ISO 1250 and 1600.      This camera definitely rocks.  The small size means that it's easy to keep in my pocket at all times.  My other camera is a Nikon D700 with a huge, heavy lens that I hate to take out just because of its size.  The S95 is giving my pro camera a run for its money.  The picture quality is great and the in-camera scenes give you so many options as well as full manual mode.  Shutter lag is virtually non-existent.  The LCD screen is bright and fairly accurate as far as colors.  My last Canon, the G9, had a purplish tint to the LCD and didn't display colors properly.  The S95's screen is polarized which makes it much easier to see in bright sunlight.  The downside to this is that if you wear polarized sunglasses, the screen goes black when turned horizontally.      The ergonomics of this camera leave a little to be desired.  It's not easy to turn on or off with one hand and i'm always struggling with how to hold it while shooting.  I find that I press buttons accidentally.  I suppose that's to be expected on a camera that's this small.  I'm also less than impressed with the HD video.  The picture quality was great considering it's a p&s but it is a little jumpy since it only records 24 fps.  Battery life is a little short, 1/2 a day of shooting (about 150 photos, a few >1 minute videos and some playback).  If you plan to take this camera on vacation, do yourself a huge favor and get a spare battery.",,,,,,
110,LG,4,Chris Boylan,"Having reviewed previous LG Blu-ray players, including the vaunted <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UQ6F5M"">BD390</a>, our expectations for the BD570 were pretty high and happily, LG does not disappoint.  While some of LG's competitors (notably Pioneer and Sharp), think audio/video performance is the only thing that matters, LG embraces the idea that convenience and choice of media and distribution format are also important to many consumers.  So the BD570 includes one of the richest media playback offerings of any Blu-ray player, including internet streaming from Netflix, CinemaNow, VUDU and Pandora.  The player also supports DLNA networking so it can access audio and video files on a home network as well. For those who have a library of videos on their computers, the BD570 supports Divx, Xvid and MKV files as well as a number of other formats and codecs.      As far as load times are concerned, the BD570's are decent but not winning any speed records.  It offers a 17 second overall bootup time (while it loads all of the aforementioned content options in the menu) - this makes it 3 seconds faster than the Pioneer BDP-320 which offers no multimedia options.  Standard DVDs load in about 12 seconds, Blu-rays in 23 seconds, and BD-JAVA-heavy Blu-ray Discs like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" in 32 seconds.  This is pretty close to parity with the fastest models of 2009 (including OPPO's BDP-83) but it seems like they could have improved things a bit with this whole new generation of players.     In terms of performance, the BD570 delivers Blu-ray Discs in excellent audio and video clarity (as it should), and performs most of the difficult tasks of DVD upconversion right as well - excellent diagonal filtering and 3:2 cadence detection, for example.  But it does not handle noisy source material very well (its noise reduction processing could use some work).  Overall, as a DVD upconverter, it's very good but not outstanding.      What is outstanding is the built-in 802.11b/g/n WiFi wireless networking.  For us this worked right our of the box connecting to our wireless router, and streaming VUDU's 1080p HDX movies like nobody's business.  And although the remote looks almost upside down compared to many other BD player remotes, the button layout is actually quite comfortable with the most popular buttons in easy reach of your thumb, and transport buttons (play/pause/FF/REW) raised and angled for improved ergonomics.    Overall, with its built-in WiFi, DLNA networking, multimedia playback and internet streaming offerings, combined with solid Blu-ray playback, the BD570 offers a good blend of performance and convenience for a fairly affordable price.  Our complete review of the BD570 is available on Big Picture Big Sound (dot com).",,,,,,
111,LG,5,Peter W. Broido,"Having been bitten by the blu ray bug, I initially purchased a LG BD370. I liked the machine a great deal, had several questions and called LG technical support which at best was indifferent. I decided I wanted a second blu ray player and would not reward LG, so I purchased a Sony BDP-S570. It came, set up was arduous as I didn't realize at first that you can scroll both up and down but eventually I got the machine working. I did however have compatibility problems. The Sony using HDMI tried to take over my Samsung LCD TV. The two fought a great deal and I ended up calling Sony support. The support person, unlike the one I spoke to at LG was very helpful, caring etc. We spent about an hour trying to make the two products compatible without success and I returned the Sony. As the older LG had worked well with my Samsung, I purchased the BD 570. The following are my observations on my system. From the time I took the LG out of the box to connecting it wirelessly to my WiFi router, setting up Netflix and Pandora took less than 15 minutes. After I set up the LG and turned it off and then on, it asked me if I wanted to upgrade the software which it did in less than 10 minutes. This entire process was much easier on the LG than the Sony. The Sony promises to be upgradeable to 3 D, the LG is not upgradeable to 3 D. The Sony offers connections to more movie and internet programs than one can imagine. The LG offers many less but has the only two I care about Netflix and Pandora. Start up( from the time the player is turned on until you can use it) was well over 2 minutes for the Sony and well under a minute for the LG; note other reviewers have said boot time for the Sony was quick but that was not the case in my system. I think the quality of a blu ray movie is slightly better with the LG - give the Sony a 94 and LG a 98 - not much but enough so I could see a difference. The Netflix menu is much nicer and more user friendly with the LG. In both players you see a list of your instant movies but if you want to go to a description it requires more steps in the Sony - not that it is bad, the LG is easier and nicer. With regards to upscaling conventional DVDs, both players do a very good job. I did not play any old DVDs which were formatted for older cathode ray TVs on the Sony. They present in the 4:3 format on the LG and you can manually make them full screen. This is not an automatic process on the LG. I did not play an older DVD on the Sony so I don't know how it handles older DVDs formatted for a cathode ray TV. The instruction book for the Sony is useless. It refers you to the Sony website for virtually all answers. I might add, I didn't care for the web site either; this begs the question why do they have an instruction book? The LG instruction book does actually have instructions in it and seemed fairly complete.  Had I not had compatibility issues, I probably would have kept the Sony although I found the long time to boot up very annoying. I'm glad I got the LG, I think it has a better blu ray picture.",,,,,,
112,LG,4,David Becker,"I'm very pleased with the BD-570 overall.  I hadn't planned on buying a Blu-Ray player - standard DVDs look very good played through my upconverting Sony DVD player to my 60"" HD TV.  Then, about 6 months ago, we dropped HBO and replaced it with a Netflix subscription.  We watched a few Netflix DVDs, and then I started watching Netflix content on my computer using their terrific network streaming. I was hooked and started researching how I could get the Netflix streaming to my big TV in the living room.    I tried software servers (PlayOn, Mezzmo) on my computer feeding to my DirecTV DVR - a nightmare to set up, a lot of glitches, and very mixed results.  Then I researched Roku, Boxee, WDTV, and other hardware solutions.  I finally concluded that replacing my DVD player with a network enabled Blu-Ray was the way to go rather than yet another box, another remote, and more cables.  For just a few dollars more than a Roku or WDTV box I could have a much simpler setup and upgrade to Blu-Ray disk at the same time.    I quickly settled on the LG BD-570 as the best value and combination of network services.  I didn't concern myself with the actual Blu-Ray performance, assuming it would be satisfactory - and it definitely is.  This review focuses on the networking capability of the BD-570 and it's usability for that purpose.    The physical design is sleek and compact.  A wireless network adapter is built in to the player - there's no visible antenna or external device.  It's the latest ""N"" wireless.  Setup was simple and quick to connect to my Belkin N wireless router.  Performance of the wireless connection is excellent.    The interface design is a little weird however.  The main menu has just six choices including Setup.  I guess the LG designers wanted to provide some entertainment value to this menu so it presents itself as a set of dancing ice cubes.  With little bubbles rising behind them.  I'm not kidding.  This doesn't make the player any worse (or any better) to use - it's just silly and pointless.    Anyway, this first menu simply allows choosing the source of your media.  The first three choices all refer to the disk player - movie, music, and pictures.  Then you have ""Home Link"" to choose from your files on your home network and ""Netcast"" - their range of internet services.      Insert your Blu-Ray or regular DVD, or a music CD, or a CD or DVD you have created on your computer with video, music, or photo files.  A very long list of file formats are supported - probably everything you might encounter.  It all plays seamlessly.    If you insert a USB flash drive into the convenient port on the front of the player, the main menu disappears and you are again offered the choice of movie, music, or photo to play your media from the USB - same as a disk.    Playing your own files from a disk or from a USB flash drive works perfectly - a list of files comes up quickly.  There are several visual arrangements available for viewing file lists - just like on a Windows computer.  Just point to a file and press play for any of the many supported video, music, or photo file formats.  Everything renders beautifully - video and photos are sized correctly for your screen resolution and the 16:9 format.  Photo slide shows with your choice of music are available.  You'll want to read the manual and play around to learn how to change the slide show speed, add music, etc.  Controls are generally well implemented.  You can fast forward and reverse video (or music) files using the controls just like you were playing a DVD.  Audio/video sync is always perfect - that's sometimes a problem playing computer video files.    The ""Home Link"" function also works very well.  This is the LG implementation of the DLNA standard that allows media sharing to many kinds of devices.  It automatically finds any DLNA servers on your network - which basically means all your computers.  It shows the folders on those computers which you have set to share their content on your network.  Again, just scroll to any video, music, or photo file or folder and play it.  The speed with which you can navigate large lists of music or photo files is very impressive - it scrolls through them just as fast as if you were sitting at your computer. This is a very clean and high performing DLNA implementation.  Others I have experienced are so slow and awkward as to be unusable. (I'm looking at you DirecTV!)    Finally the Netcast option brings up a new menu with a number of network services.  Another bizarre menu design, this one shows the main street of a small town in the background, with the symbols for each of the network services scrolling horizontally at the bottom.  The picture of the town changes according to the time of day - day, sunset, night.  Really, LG?  Does this somehow improve the user experience?  Instead of a single scrolling row of choices that requires you to scroll right or left to even see what all the choices are, how about a simple grid that could easily show all the choices at once - and reduce the number of button presses to get to the one you want.  That's how everyone else does it.  But then we wouldn't be amazed by the clever cartoon background with its changing lightscape.    That's an easily forgiven minor issue once you start using the various services which all work just fine and open up a vast array of both paid and free internet content.  See the product description for the full list.  I'll only comment on the most important of these - Netflix.  To be clear, you must subscribe to Netflix to use the service.  $8 a month for instant access to many thousands of movies and TV series through the network streaming service; $10 a month for the streaming and unlimited DVDs (one at a time) by postage paid mail.  To stream Netflix to your LG Blu-Ray player you will need to register the player through the Netflix web site - a very simple process that the LG player actually helps you with.      Netflix works beautifully on this player, with basically the same great implementation you see using Netflix streaming on your computer.  You can browse your Instant Watch queue and you can also browse many genres, the content Netflix suggests for you, add to your queue, etc.  This is a much more complete interface to Netflix than some other players have and you should understand this difference before you choose a device that requires you to go to the Netflix web site on your computer to look for movies.    When playing you can pause, fast forward or reverse at multiple speeds.  Netflix actually shows you a set of thumbnail images you can scroll through to find any place you are seeking in your movie.  This is a great feature that I believe is unique to Netflix.    The video quality is very good, assuming you have a good broadband internet connection - 5 megabits per second or more.  Netflix will work with a slower connection, or if your connection temporarily slows down, by scaling the video quality down dynamically to keep within your bandwidth limitations.  This eliminates any stuttering or buffering pauses you might otherwise experience.    Finally, there is a huge range of free internet content available through the ""DivxTV"" service in the Netcast menu.  This is a web service that aggregates and catalogs many other individual web content providers - see the DivxTV web site ([...]) for more information.      This player is a great value, performs well and is missing very little.  It might be nice to have Amazon Video on Demand in addition to the already included Vudu and CinemaNow services.  I think we can expect firmware updates (easily delivered and installed via the internet connection!) in the near future that will add even more internet services.  Good job overall, LG - now hire some new graphic designers to clean up your silly menus!  ",,,,,,
113,LG,2,Michael Rodriguez,"First, this was my first blu-ray player.  I did my research and most users really enjoyed the LG products over the less costly Samsung models.  The model I was originally going to purchase was the LG BD570's predecessor.  In the end I went with this LG model expecting one of the best products at this price value.  I was unfortunately let down.  Here was my issue:    I purchased this player and the new Terminator Salvation DVD to test it out.  The player was a breeze to hook up and I was excited to watch the movie.  However, this is where the problem started.  It would not play a blu-ray disc.  The LG has a ""home"" screen as many blu-ray players do.  In order to watch a movie, you select ""movie.""  When doing that the player was stuck in what I will refer to as a loop.  The player will flash to the beginning of the movie for a second or less, then flash back to the home screen.  In order to actually watch the movie you would need to continually select ""movie"" until the actual DVD begins with the credits.  During the FBI warning, rating, etc...it continually looped back to the home screen.  Just to note, standard DVDs played without an issue.  I thought perhaps this was a DVD problem, but another blu-ray DVD (Spaceballs) had the same issue although not as bad.  I called LG tech support whom were very unhelpful.  There idea of tech support and the only support they gave after both a phone call and an e-mail was to turn the machine off and turn it back on.  I could have told them that that was likely not going to fix my issue.  So, knowing that something is wrong with the player I assumed I had a bad apple and returned it for the same model.  After hooking up the new one, it had the same issue.  Also this issue was not firmware since there are no firmware updates for this model.  I checked both the wireless network connection of the player and online.  After two of these models having the same issue, I returned the second and actually purchased the Sony S570 model.  After hooking that one up, both of the blu-ray movies I was attempting to play worked flawlessly, thus confirming my belief that both of the LG models were poorly made and not functioning as expected.      With that being said, if you choose to purchase this model, here are my pros and cons:    Pros:  - Very easy to set up  - Wireless network was easy to set up and worked well  - As silly as it sounds, I liked the remote.  - Network options (Netflix and Pandora)    Cons:  - Issues playing blu-ray discs  - Very slow load times (which were confirmed when experiencing the Sony load times which were about half)  - Cost (the Sony is $30 less in most places)  - I did not like the flip down front    Overall, I wanted this player to be great based on what people were saying about LG models, but it didn't.  The Sony model I ended up with has all of the same functionality, short of Pandora, at less cost.  The Sony also functioned perfectly out of the box.  I would recommend the Sony over this model, but it is your choice.  I hope you don't get 2 bad apples like I did.",,,,,,
