I pre-ordered late, now i'm eagerly awaiting my first Kindle.      I had a chance to play with the nook and just wasn't that impressed with it.  I've never used an e-book reader before, so perhaps i'm being overly picky.   It seemed slow to use.   The color touchscreen bugged me for some reason.  Maybe it's the difference of the e-ink side-by-side with a backlit LCD.    The nook also completely locked up in the store while the BN employee was doing the demo on it :)   I just didn't feel any ""chemistry"" with the nook.   I'm normally impatient and tend to buy stuff a bit quicker than I should.   I was unimpressed enough by the nook to opt to wait for the Kindle.  The charcoal K3 is very understated and clean.  It's like it escaped from Apple's labs.",1,0,0,1,04,1,0.8181818,Lael,Question - I saw on your cover review that you got both the grey and the white versions.

Many reviews of the Kindle DX and the new graphite K3 say that text seems to ""pop"" or stand out more due to the psychological effect of having a dark ""frame"" around the ""page.""  My wife agrees with that.  I set them side by side and I cannot tell the difference, honestly, but so many people can, there must be something to it.    Since I can't tell the difference, I chose white for very superficial reasons.    1) I think the white kindle looks better with most of the colors of Amazon cases. for example I put my wife's graphite K3 in my green Amazon lighted case and I just didn't like the color combination.  I also cannot imagine pairing the graphite K3 with one of the warmer color cases, like burnt orange or brown.  But that's totally subjective, everyone has different tastes and mine are not better than anyone else's.    2) I believe that most people will now buy the graphite (DX and K3-wifi only come in graphite; K3-3G comes in both but graphite is new and ""sexy"", apparently), and therefore white will soon be the more ""rare,"" unique color.  I like having something different than everyone else.  (Of course, my K3 is the same color is the millions of K2s out there, so it's not THAT unique!)",0,0,1,1,07,1,0.9431818,Chibacat,"Great review! Thanks much. A friend tried to talk me into buying a Nook last December and I hesitated. Now I'm glad I did. Never had an e-reader (never have ordered first generation anything) and this Kindle 3 I  ordered will be a first. I didn't care about a color screen or being able to loan books that Nook offered. I needed the ability to read outside pretty much anywhere, change text size and font...simple things. Since most of my reading will be done in the western North woods of MI (where there's nothing but trees and critters! LOL) I wanted both 3G and wi-fi which Kindle 3 offered.

I initially thought the ""loan"" feature was a huge Nook advantage until I looked at it closer. You can only loan a book one time, and only if it is enabled by the publisher.

More and more ex-nook users are coming out and saying that borrowing books from the library in ePub format has not worked well for them.

(The technology exists to allow a library to loan a single ePub book to many users at the same time, but publishers typically don't allow this because they fear it will reduce their sales.)

Was thinking about it as well. I sneered when Kindle first came out. I didn't like the first device (I never buy new tech anyway anymore - let the suckers put up with the bugs) and I thought the price of books was too high. A friend though pointed out that with printing costs virtually nil, when I purchase a hard copy, most of what I am paying for is marketing, production and royalty - so there is little difference in cost between the hard and digital - made sense. Enough for me to download Kindle and start using it on my BlackBerry (great for flights). Also, I like the lack of limitation in hardware - I can read the same purchase on my iMac or BlackBerry - so can re-download to the new device I am buying without repurchasing the book! I in fact cut the cord on a recent trip and didn't carry any paper books with me - using my BlackBerry for one solid week. I managed but it left me thirsting for a much better reader. As good as my Bold 9700 is, I get tired of looking at a lighted (and small) screen.  The combination of the improved quality and the lower price weakened me - but the addition of WiFi and 3G put the nail in the coffin - and I have ordered the 3G version in graphite with a lighted cover case. Hopefully will come in time for my next trip.  One thing I have told friends is that so many other book programs make you pay for EVERYTHING - I like Kindle due to the vast offering of 0 cost public domain documents.",1,0,0,1,022,1,0.5625,Adam N.

My wife uses the nook and has to read with it plugged in a lot.  After a few weeks of this I decided I would call the customer service desk and get a new nook.  After going back and forth with the supervisor (i have replaced a kindle too due to the hinge issue and they overnighted me a new kindle with no questions asked) I finally convinced them to send me a new refurb.  The battery life was exactly the same.  I strongly recommend against buying a nook for this reason.  I cannot get more than 4 days charge out of it with only moderate reading.

However, I am less worried after reading some of the comments here.  First, it may be possible to replace your own battery, and at lower cost than sending your kindle back to Amazon.  One of the first comments is from someone who found a website with information on this, and I have heard of people very safely replacing batteries in their ipods (when Apple says the ipod battery is not user-replaceable and Apple mails you a refurbished ipod when you send yours in for a replacement - just like Amazon and the Kindle).    More importantly perhaps, another comment convinced me that we may never need to replace our batteries.  The batteries in Kindles are rated for a huge number of recharge cycles, equivalent to something like 6 years of usage.  I'll be lucky if I keep my kindle for 3 years before giving into the temptation of buying a newer model.    Others have said they like the idea of getting a factory refurbished kindle for the price of a new battery - I personally disagree, I would rather keep my own kindle, but I can see how people would find this appealing.  And since Amazon is a highly reputable company, I cannot imagine they would ship a scratched up, stained kindle to you and called it ""refurbished.""

To me, that one feature makes Kindle the preferable ereader.  And I can access my Kindle books from my Macbook, my Iphone or my Kindle at any time, because of the Archive feature.  For the person who was asking about whether it would be worth the extra $50 to get the 3G instead of the Kindle 3, I would say that would depend on whether you have wi-fi at home.  If so, you can purchase any books you want to read while at home (or in another wi-fi area), or you can just order books from your amazon account, and when you're in a wi-fi area they will upload to your Kindle.  I have a Kindle 2 which can access the Kindle store from anywhere, but since I can order books with my IPhone or my macbook and they go the archive, I can still access them on the Kindle 3 my husband just bought for my birthday.

That's like saying a PC will never freeze again or a Mac will hever require a force-set.      But the paper clip or anything else was for the Kindle 1 that had a recessed reset-button that is like the ones you find on your cablemodem or other electronic items today that let you reset a unit easily and effectively.  This was not actually on the battery at all of course.    It was at the back of the unit when you slide the cover off. There was no way you could ""muck it up,"", using the reset/restart  hole in the back (marked ""reset"" but it is like pressing the SMALL re-start button of  a PC rather than the main 'on' 'off' or power button.    In two years, my K1 has not failed me but in the beginning I used to push many buttons all at once, which can confuse it so it would just stop accepting 'commands' ...  I learned not to be so impatient after the beginning and it didn't happen again.      The Kindle warrantys and Amazon Kindle customer service are extremely flexible.       Since this thread includes info on the Nook, it has had a history of reboots and freezes.

A few took longer but the ones that had to wait for a full second said it was not earthshaking but concerned them and was irritating.

It helped to clarify some of my questions, but since I don't understand electronics that much I am still confused.  Regarding your statement:    ""The 3G model is potentially more convenient than the Wi-Fi+3G model because 3G is the technology used in cell-phones, which has a wider coverage than Wi-Fi. On the other hand, if you want to send your own material to your Kindle, you will have to pay to use the 3G service, whereas Wi-Fi transfers are free. Purchases are transferred free via 3G.""  If you have Wi-Fi +3G isn't that actually better than just having 3G, since 3G has wide coverage?  Additionally what material of my own might I want to send to a Kindle as you state I would have to pay to use 3G.  Additionally if I have Wi-Fi in my home, do I need 3G?  What would the advantage be?  You say that purchases are transferred free via 3G, when books, etc are purchased with just Wi-Fi are there costs for those transfers.  Thanks for any help you can give!",0,0,1,0,076,1,1,Arts&HistoryFan,"Mary,    The models are either WiFi-only or 3G+WiFi ... so Julian's advice that it costs (about 15c) to send a personal doc direct to your Kindle device is about when you CHOOSE to do it that way (if one doesn't have a WiFi system at home that you connect with etc so you send it via 3G though there are other free ways).    A personal doc is like a Word doc you or someone wrote, which you'd like to have on your Kindle -- or a PDF info sheet or manual that you'd like to have on the Kindle or any number of interesting pieces on the web that you'd like put on your Kindle (there are various ways).    When you send such a document to [yourself]@free.kindle.com after approving your regular email to send to your Kindle device, that means Amazon will convert it (if necessary) and send you a link to download it to your computer -- so you can move it to your Kindle 'documents' folder via the USB cable that is part of your power cord -- AND they send a copy via WiFi as well, which if you are set up with WiFi at home or office or use Starbucks' or McDonald's will go to your Kindle at no cost when you log on to a WiFi network somewhere.  3G is more like a cellphone and it's all around you if there is AT&T cellphone service in your area.    It's never 3G instead of WiFi.  The only 3G model ALSO has WiFi.    Any book you purchase from Amazon has no added charges for delivery to your Kindle.  Those are more public docs or books.    A personal doc is something you created or found or that was given to you outside Amazon.  Some of us have ToDo lists or recipies and other things on our Kindles and they're personal docs also.    To see the difference between WiFi-only and 3G/WiFi model capabilities, you can read my piece at http://bit.ly/kw3gwifi which some have told me is pretty clear.  I hope so.   - Andrys",0,0,1,1,077,1,0,token,"J. Mabry, this is a good idea with the library for the Nook. Can I go on each state's library site to sign up for a library card eventhough, don't belong to that state or is there a certain site go on?  Thanks for this info!!",0,0,1,0,078,1,1,Ron Cronovich,"Regarding the wifi vs. 3G debate, all of your comments have covered this issue pretty well, but I'd add just a couple minor things.    Remember, you only need internet connectivity to download content, not to read content.  (Well, except for when you want to use kindle's browser, but let's set that aside for the moment).  If you have wifi at home, then the only time you'd need 3G is to download content when you're away from home, and that's only when you can't get to a wifi hotspot.  Free wifi hotspots are getting more and more common:  many hotel chains have, all starbucks locations, many other coffee shops and libraries offer free wifi.  Also, there are definitely a fair number of dead zones around the country where 3G coverage is spotty or nonexistent.  And worse comes to worse, if you load your kindle up with content before leaving home, you might not even need an internet connection while you're traveling.  All of this argues in favor of getting the wifi only kindle and saving yourself $50.    That said, there are a couple reasons why the 3G might be worthwhile.  The main one is if you travel a lot and subscribe to a daily newspaper, then you can still get your newspaper every day, even if your hotel (or relatives' house) doesn't have wifi.  If you take the subway to work, you can surf the Amazon store and download magazines and newspapers.  Etc etc.    Another consideration is that $50 is not much to spend for lifetime 3G internet connectivity.  Granted, you can't do nearly as much on the internet with a kindle as with a smartphone or ipad.  But still, $50 is not bad.  If you own your Kindle for two years, that comes to about $2 or so per month.    The last reason, and I admit this is going to sound pretty lame, is that the 3G kindle is the only one that comes in white anymore.  The wifi only kindle comes only in graphite.  I'm guessing that the vast majority of people will buy graphite.  I personally picked white because I don't want the same color as everyone else.  (Well, of course everyone who has a kindle 1 or 2, or an older DX, has white, so I guess mine isn't THAT unique!)  Bottom line, I think the choice between 3G and wifi isn't a critical choice in the sense that, no matter which you pick, you probably won't regret it.  (Unlike nook vs. kindle, I think some people who bought one of them without first learning about their differences and respective advantages are at risk of coming to regret their decision, which is why I hope my overly long and wordy review will help people avoid that.)    Good luck!  -Ron",0,0,0,1,079,1,0,Whitneymuse,"very nice and informative review; I won't go deep into the weeds, but there were some features and terms I was not even aware until I read yours so it prompted me to do some research and get up to speed in 2010; that's all I'll say now, but thanks for taking the time and cover the topics you did.",1,0,0,0,080,1,1,Arts&HistoryFan,"It's also not true that if you have Wi-Fi in your home then you don't need 3G because it's like saying you don't need cell-phone reception if you stay home most of the time.    This e-reader has a quite capable free 3G web-browser on it and MANY of us use it outside the home to look up restaurants, theaters, phone numbers, reviews of each before deciding but it comes in handy most of all when you are *lost* and don't have a GPS with you.    No way with WiFi-only could you turn on your Kindle in a car (as a passenger or as a driver who has pulled over)) and go to Google Maps - Text version and put in where you are and where you need to be and have step-by-step directions within about 20 seconds.    See http://bit.ly/kdriving  to see how that's done.  It's not even difficult, but is a great feature that can be used almost anywhere on this globe.    Amazon's 3G is available wherever there is AT&T reception for cell phones and essentially that's what you're using - ""Free 3G cell-phone network web browser"" - no monthly charges.    You wouldn't use it often but it can be a lifesaver when you need something and then you also know you don't have to pay data charges with it for the web look-ups the way you do with cell phones which are on monthly fees.    Also, WiFi networks do break down.  Electricity goes out.  Power outages are not that uncommon anymore (at least where I live.)    It's a not-good savings if you have the opportunity to connect with the outside world with the 3G cellphone part in those circumstances, but you saved $50 and don't have it.   It allows you to use email (slowly but at least it's possible).    This Kindle is not just about downloading books anymore.  Julian has the right idea in not limiting himself.   This 3G cellphone type access for free is usable by U.S. residents in about 100 cities worldwide.     That means you can get directions when you're in another country, from the sidewalk, from a bus, from anywhere, not dependent on a working wifi somewhere that wants you to put in a password etc.   Also, I don't like to ask friends for their WiFi password when visiting.

I usually kept the wi-fi turned on, so I could order a book when I thought about it - ordered some free classics to read while in the States.  In the process, my battery had dropped to about 1/3 left, so I decided the night before my flight to recharge the battery.  I unplugged it right before going to the airport.  When I got on the plane and opened my Kindle 3, it started that re-booting thing....which, naturally, after reading all these reviews, freaked me out.  Additionally, it had lost my place in the book I was reading, and I couldn't sync to the furthest page read.  My Kindle wasn't storing  that information on the device, and I was not in a wi-fi area on the plane.  So I had to go search for my place in the book, then I had to keep watching my location at the bottom of the screen in case the Kindle started re-booting again, which it did at least three times during my 16 hour travel to Houston before going on to SC.  In the airport there, I tried to find a wi-fi area, but with my limited time, was unsuccessful.  So for the flight to SC, I just had to keep on keeping track of my location and writing it down before putting the Kindle to sleep each time.  It was a very big hassle!  When I arrived in SC and got settled in, yesterday, I called Kindle customer service.  The guy told me that the problem had been corrected, and that I only needed to download the update from Amazon onto my Kindle.  He walked me through it, so  now it is working okay....knock on wood.  :)  However, I have decided to go ahead and order the 3G and send back the Kindle 3 for a refund.  My husband said that if the Kindle 3 keeps working, he may decide to take it and use it instead of his Kindle 2.  He likes the compact size, and it will fit in his military uniform leg pocket...no problem.  For his purposes, it should be good.  I actually already ordered the 3G, and will pick it up on the 16th at my son's house in Missouri and have a chance to use it for a week before heading back home to my little island in the sun.  :)  I still love Kindle, but this one sure did put a scare into me.  :)",0,0,0,1,0100,1,1,Joy Kelley,"There are three basic differences between Kindle 2 and Kindle 3.  One is the size - Kindle 3 is much smaller and easier to carry in a purse or even in a larger pocket.  Another difference is the speed and smoothness in which the pages turn.  It is a significant improvement in the Kindle 3, which reads much faster and smoother.  One downside I found with the Kindle 3, is the text-to-speech feature.  In Kindle 2, there is usually a very distinct pause when you come to a comma or a period.  In Kindle 3, there is NO pause, and it's difficult to understand.  My husband was telling me yesterday that he might want to keep the Kindle 3 to use for himself (he has the Kindle 2), since it can fit into his uniform pantleg pocket, where the Kindle 2 can't.  But he has dyslexia and needs the text-to-speech feature.  When I just tried using that feature on my new Kindle 3, to check it out for this review, I learned about the problem with the lack of pause at commas and periods.  That brings the Kindle 3 WAY down for anyone who likes being read to by the device.

I have been debating with myself about this for several months now, actually since amazon came out with the two new ones. I know I don't want the one  (I think it is the DX) that costs close to $400., not only because of the price but also because of the weight. I have arthritis in the joints of my thumbs, plus my hands get numb even holding a tiny cell phone, so I doubt I could handle the DX. Can you please give me your opinion about the differences between the two new Kindles? Why is the $189. one higher priced? What does it do that the $139. does not? I don't mind paying the $50. difference if there is a valid reason. Please reply if you possibly can as soon as you read this, as I am ready to order one or the other as soon as I hear back from you.

One, it turns out you can replace the battery yourself, there are internet retailers that sell kindle batteries and include instructions on how to change it, some have a 2-minute video online that demonstrates how to replace the battery.  The price is cheaper than amazon charges for battery replacement, and best of all you get to keep YOUR kindle.  Google ""kindle battery"" for more info.   My sister in law has a nook and just had a warranty issue.  Rather than fixing her nook, Barnes & Noble replaced it with a refurbished one.

Larkins,"This is to all the nice, wonderful people on this forum that has responded to my question about which of the two new Kindles that would be best for me to purchase.  I decided to buy the higher priced of the two new Kindles, I think it is the one that has ""G3"" on it, and though I went to the site that Andrys recommended and read every word of it, and still can't describe it to anyone else, I do understand the function now, I think, and since we travel a lot, I believe I need that feature. My son had told me that fact once before but since he (like myself) understood it, he could not explain it to me in a way that I could understand so I needed more input and info before I made my decision. I have been debating on whether or not I would actually use a Kindle since the very first one came out a few years ago, then when the very expensive DX came out a couple of years later, I was torn even more because IF I decided to go for it, I couldn't make up my mind between the Kindle 2 or the DX, and naturally, I was leaning toward the DX but was torn between paying that outrageous amount of money for something so frivolous!  Let's face it, a Kindle, no matter which one we get, is not a necessity, it is a fun gadget, and I happen to love gadgets but have to rein myself in and use common sense occasionally, so I have chosen the Kindle that seems to have all that I will need and still be usable (and not cost an arm and a leg) when we are on the road traveling.  I think the $189. Kindle is perfect for me and I have ordered one of the lighted covers in Burgundy Red to go with it. I ordered them both from amazon last night!  As for an iPad, I don't even know what that is so I doubt that I could learn to use it. I hope that I will be able to master the Kindle without much trouble.  I am 73 years old and will soon be 74, so all of these electronics and computerized stuff does not come as easy for me to learn as it does the younger generations. I have read all of the reviews on amazon regarding all the Kindles while I have been trying to make up my mind, and most all have helped, I kept learning more and more, but I needed specific info about the features and the functions, and though it was answered to a degree on the comparable chart that amazon provides, I still needed it explained in a more deltailed way, and all of you have been wonderfully generous about sharing your views and knowledge with me and I appreciate it enormously! Even reviews from users who do not like it or prefer some other brand is a help because it tells me what other brands offer, the pros and cons of the Kindles and also of the Nook and I believe there is one from Sony that I have read about also.  Each and every review has helped me in one way or another.  Again, thanks to each and every one of you!

That was my biggest holdback on ordering the Kindle after I decided to go ahead and purchase one of the new ones that came out this year, I did not know which one I wanted or needed.

I will say, though, that not having epub support with the Kindles is a major deficit, as a LOT of free books can be obtained in that format, so it's something people really need to consider. Battery life with the Nook will never come near equaling that of the Kindle 3 (or even the older models), because of the bottom lcd screen, but some of the other issues, like slower page turns are being addressed by the B&N folk with firmware upgrades. Here's the latest official B&N announcement concerning the next firmware version:  //You asked, we listened: NOOK 1.5 Update is Coming! In our biggest update since we launched NOOK a year ago, we will dramatically increase NOOK 3G and NOOK Wi-Fi`s page turn speed and deliver the features and performance enhancements most-requested from all of you!   The 1.5 update includes improved search on the device, customized B&N Library organization and password protection. It also includes the ability to sync across all NOOK and all devices enabled with our free NOOK apps, by syncing your last page read. If you forget your NOOK at home, use the NOOK app for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Android smartphone or PC to pick up where you left off. And, the next time you pick up your NOOK, the Reading Now page will be updated and ready to go.  The NOOK 1.5 software update is expected to be available late next month via Wi-Fi or manual download at www.NOOK.com/support.   In other NOOK news, NOOK for Android will also be getting an updated -- expected later this week. NOOK for Android v2.3 includes many customer-requested features including the ability to ""Go To"" a specific page number, search within a book, view highlights and notes, delete books from the library, plus an updated home screen and enhancements to make reading and managing side-loaded content easier.

But it sounds like you're more interested in the subjective impressions of people who have used both.  I am one such person, and my opinion is that the extra weight of the DX was an issue for me.  For long leisure reading sessions, holding the DX in one hand was fatiguing after a while.  Also, the page turn button placement isn't as good on the DX as on the 3, especially if you're holding it in one hand and turning pages with the same hand.    On the other hand, the extra large display of the DX was GREAT.  I really loved it.  So there's definitely a trade-off here.    Of course, these are my subjective impressions, not irrefutable fact.  I'm sure you can find people who have a DX and consider the weight to be quite manageable.  If I would have kept the DX instead of getting a 3, I'm sure I would have adapted to the weight - e.g., rest it on a desk or my knees or something while reading for long periods at a time.     I'm sorry I can't give you a definitive answer.  But here's a suggestion that might help:  it was reported last month that Best Buy would soon begin selling all current kindle models, including the DX, and they would have fully functional display units in every store for customers to try.  Staples, too, I think.  So maybe you can find a store nearby that has the 3 and the DX, and hold both in your own hands.     Good luck!",0,0,1,1,0130,1,0.5,Jill R. Tarant,Wow!

I do have the cover on my Kindle but haven't read any books on it yet so haven't had occasion to use the light yet. I do have one question still for all of the good people that have helped me so much in the past in regard to Kindles. Should I leave the cover on the Kindle when I am not using it? Does that cause any problems of any type! I put the cover on when I first received them both from amazon and have not taken the cover off since then, as I have barely had my hands on it since the day it arrived! I really need to know if it is not recommended to leave the cover on when the Kindle is not in use. Thank you again, you have all helped me with so much in regard to Kindles in the past month or so. And to everyone who answered all of my questions when I was trying to decide if I actually wanted to buy a Kindle and to all of the nice folks who gave me so much information about the differences between the two newer model Kindles, (I chose the Kindle G3 or 3G, I'm not sure which is correct here and don't want to take the time to check on it right now) and I have had it for almost a couple of weeks now, but have not used it enough to be able to make an accurate report on it right now. I do know the one thing that is not to my liking and I had not even considered this before I bought a Kindle and it probably would not have deterred me had I known about it, as it is a small problem (no pun intended) but the keys on the Kindle are so small, they are actually very tiny, they aren't even as large around as an English pea (and they are the very small peas, like baby peas) so I have a strong premonition that I am going to have a problem manipulating the keyboard while trying to use them!  I have blunt like and clunky fingers and the keyboard is so small I know it is going to be nigh to impossible for me to use it with any accuracy. I will have to think of some kind of small, pointed tool or device to help me to type on it.  But so far, I have barely had time to do more than look at my new Kindle. Have had a lot of out-of-town guests that all stayed awhile and also, trying to get things ready for a cross-country auto trip (from Georgia to California to visit son) and haven't had time to even play around with the Kindle yet. Hopefully I will have the time to do that while we are on the trip. I will take it and all directions that came with it with me and study it so that I will know what I am doing when I decide to download some books.  I have seen the screen with some text on it and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the words look and I can actually read it easier and better than I can most books! One more thing that I am very happy with, the toggle thingee that you turn the pages with, it is easier than turning a page in a book, it was so much faster for me than turning pages in a real book. Half the time the paper pages stick together and I am forever turning two or even three pages at a time in a book when I am trying to turn just one! More later when I have had time to get to know it better!

Like you, I got the Amazon case with the light built in, and got one for my wife's kindle (also a ""3"").  We both leave our kindles in the case all the time, and we both use the light a lot.  It really helps.  When we drove a long distance, after sunset one of us would read our kindle while the other drove - if you use the light and make the font bigger, it's more comfortable reading the kindle than reading a book in the car.    If you have time before your trip, load up your new kindle with some books so you have good reading material while you're away.

This 3G connection to the internet works very well, as long as you are in an area with 3G coverage - coverage is good in most of the well-populated parts of the U.S., but not as good in some locations that are more remote, or have low-income and low-density populations.  I think somewhere on Amazon's website you can find a map of the U.S. that shows which parts have 3G coverage.    The $139 Kindle does not have this 3G technology built in, which is why it's cheaper.  It can connect to the internet wirelessly using wi-fi, which you said you don't have in your house.  But, if you have a computer in your house that can connect to the internet, then you can download books to your computer and then transfer them from your computer to the Kindle.  Transferring files requires a cable, which is included with the Kindle.  (And if you lose it or want a second one, it is a very common type of cable, not expensive, and available at many stores like Best Buy and Walmart and Target).    This way of getting books on to your Kindle requires extra steps.  To those of us who work with computers regularly, it's pretty easy, but to someone who doesn't do much work with computers, it's probably not as easy.  But if you do it a few times, it'll become pretty easy.  You probably don't live near Milwaukee, but if you did, I'd be happy to show you.    Transferring files from your computer to your Kindle is certainly possible, but it's not nearly as convenient as using the 3G connectivity that comes with the $189 Kindle.  With the 3G Kindle, you just turn your Kindle on and you can immediately shop from Amazon's online Kindle store, right from the Kindle.    So I guess my advice is:  if it's not too much of a hardship to spend the extra $50 for the Kindle 3G model, then I think it's worth it for you.  But in these times, $50 is a lot of money to a lot of people.  As long as your computer can connect to the internet, then you can use your computer to download books and other content, then transfer it to the Kindle using the included cable.  It's less convenient, and there's a learning curve for folks that don't do a lot of work with computers.  But it's certainly possible, and not too bad once you get the hang of it.  This way, your Kindle doesn't need an internet connection, so you could get by with the $139 Kindle.    Good luck!  Best wishes, Ron C.",0,0,1,1,0152,1,1,Thelma E.

Most are classics but there are temporarily free contemporary ones on a promotional basis each day.    Also, you can download direct from Project Gutenberg to your Kindle, which has about 30,000 free books, via the 'Magic Catalog' ...      And at Internet Archive there are over 2 million free texts available for the Kindle.  Also, one can get books direct to Kindle also at feedbooks.com and mnybks.net ...  So there's a lot of choice for the thrifty.    NY Times bestsellers tend to be about $10 unless the larger publishers decide to price them higher.      The free ones from Amazon itself can be sync'd with your other Kindle-compatible devices, such as another Kindle, an iPhone or iPad, iPod touch, Blackberry, Android, Mac, PC etc. so that you can read from where you left off last on another device.    This can be done because those books are on Amazon's servers and the current location/page number can be marked and kept for you.

BUT there was only one discrepency for me... the PDF on the nook.  It does show the original PDF if the font size is set to small.  BUT, when you go larger on fonts, it reflows the text from the original PDF.  ALSO, there is the smaller mater of the expandable storage on the nook.  Something that has been a consideration of mine...  Despite my tremendous disappointment with the lack of expandable storage and lack of epub support (as well as pdf reflow support), the overall snappy performance of the K3 has won me over.  There are a host of small things I really like about the Nook; however, these do not come anywhere close to making me choose nook over k3.  BN missed the mark by not ensuring that the interface was snappy and responsive (BUT the 1.5 update made a considerable difference in page turning -- text input STILL lags big time!) and the overall importance of landscape mode for viewing PDFs.

It is possible with many but not all books, provided both Kindles are registered to the same Amazon account.  Some publishers do not allow Amazon to let people put Kindle books on more than one device at a time, but many do allow it.    To ARM-C, I like the *idea* of expandable storage on the Nook.  However, in my experience, Kindle's lack of it will not be a problem, for two reasons.  First, Kindle's included internal storage is huge (4gb vs. Nook's 2gb).  My kindle 3 has 10 purchased books and over a hundred free books (plus some MP3 files I never listen to), and I'm using only a tiny percentage of the available capacity.

Nook has also added ""shelves"" to the library (allowing you to organize books any way you desire), and does support cross-platform bookmarking in Nook applications, now. Battery life seems to have been increased, as well.   However, there is as yet no way for a Kindle to use DRM-protected ebooks purchased or borrowed from anywhere other than Amazon, and it's unlikely they'll ever allow it. Meanwhile, the Nook has support for ePub and Adobe Digital Editions, which allows Nook owners to purchase ebooks from dozens of retailers, and also allows Nook owners to borrow books from the public library. Kindle can't do this.   Yes, you can get non-DRM books from other sources and convert them to Kindle, but books that are protected (which is MOST of them) are not usable on the Kindle with just conversion-- You'd also have to strip the DRM, which is illegal and difficult. Calibre cannot strip DRM from books, and will NOT allow you to borrow library books on your Kindle.   Furthermore, as many have noted, Nook supports storage upgrades via SD cards. Kindle does not. Nook supports user-replaceable batteries. Kindle does not (you have to send your Kindle in to Amazon, and they charge you approximately eighty bucks to do it for you while you're waiting for your Kindle to come back). As pointed out, opening your Kindle voids your warranty. Replacing the battery on the Nook does not.   The reviewer also seems confused about PDF support. The Nook does, indeed, have good PDF support. In fact, having owned a Kindle 2 and a Nook, I can say the Nook's PDF support is much better, and much easier to read. I have personally put graphic-laden PDFs on the Nook and been pleased with the outcome. On the Kindle, the PDFs were hard to read because the font size was terrible.   Nook's web browsing is a FAR better experience than Kindle's because you can see the web page in color on the touch screen, and you can interact with it there as well. Instead of using a joystick to click links, you simply touch them. The full page displays on the e-ink, while the zoomed-in section shows up on the touch screen. The only negative to Nook's web browsing is that you can't browse the web via 3G on Nook; It's WiFi only.   For me, it boils down to format support, though.  I won't get another Kindle until they open it up and support what is now turning out to be the industry standard for eBooks; ePub and Adobe Digital Editions. Kindle is closed-off, and getting content for it (legitimately) requires you to be at Amazon's mercy. This means you're stuck with Amazon's availability and pricing, and I just don't like being cornered like that (especially since I've found eBooks far cheaper on Amazon's competitor sites). With the Nook, I can shop around for the best price on an ebook, and even find books that don't exist in Kindle format, because I have support for almost every internet-based ebook store out there. Converting and ripping DRM is not convenient, legal, or desirable, and the end result is not as nice as the original. Kindle takes away CHOICE, and I like having choices.  Oh, and one more thing: The Kindle doesn't do actual page numbers; It has its own numbering system, based on font size. The Nook uses page numbers, which makes finding or referring to things much easier on Nook than on the Kindle.",0,0,0,1,0199,1,1,Thomas J.

I've revised and updated the review to make it more coherent, slightly shorter, and to address two issues that have come up in recent comments:  storage capacity and the Nook version 1.5 firmware update.    I welcome the comments of Nook fans who note, quite correctly, that Nook has expandable storage, a user-replaceable battery, and compatibility with ePub; Kindle has none of these.  These are reasons I initially chose the Nook.  But after using Nook and Kindle, my experience is that Kindle's lack of these features is not a problem for me.  If you disagree, that's fine, I respect that.  But it's my review, and I honestly gave my impressions from using the two devices.    My review now mentions the new Nook version 1.5 firmware update.  To Nook fans who think I have not done justice to the awesomeness of the version 1.5 firmware, I apologize, but I have not used a Nook with this update, so I can't really say much about it.  Your comments have convinced me that it improves the experience of using the Nook. Maybe I would have kept my Nook if it had this software when I bought it.  (The one I bought was running version 1.4, which itself was a huge improvement over the initial Nook firmware, but still quite sluggish compared to the Kindle.)     I'm happy that version 1.5 improves the Nook experience.  Yet, it's hard for me to imagine that the sluggish performance of Nooks running version 1.4 and earlier is due solely to crappy firmware.  I understand that the first version of most technology gadgets is buggy, and that's one of the pitfalls of being an early adopter.  It's nice to know that B&N keeps improving the firmware.",0,0,0,1,0203,1,1,T. Madsen,"Regarding your comments on the Nook Color screen (which I now own and have been using for a couple of weeks): it may just boil down to taste, but I prefer the touch screen (with color a current nice-to-have and in the process of very quickly becoming a must-have).  For example, as far as preference for Kindle's ""dedicated keys"" - again, a matter of taste but I am looking for a direct interface with my e-reading material and a touchscreen is the only way to accomplish that.  With the Nook Color you can not only directly flip the page back/forth but more quickly and intuitively touch on a word for a look-up, highlight a section, bookmark, take notes, and generally interact with your book (and other media such as top newspapers and magazines in their intended, high-res color layout - perhaps one of the biggest market disruptors).  All of these are big differentiators for me (rather than watching movies, surfing, playing games, etc...) as I love to highlight and take notes - basically, interact - with my books and other reading material.  What I have always done with the printed page and a pencil/dictionary/encyclopedia by my side I can now do with a touch ereader - with all the tools built-in.  I am now, finally, fully sold on the ereader.  Regarding the screen brightness - I too had an issue with how intensely bright the screen was.  I then touched the lower left corner of the screen and up popped - the brightness control.  I turned it DOWN :)  Again, perhaps just me, but with the brightness down, I have not noticed any fatigue the last two weeks.  Bottom line, if I had to place the Nook Color somewhere in the current market, what I currently have is the first generation of a lighter weight, lower-cost, more reader-oriented alternative to the iPad.    Overall, you've done an excellent review - I just think the color, direct-screen approach (not to mention a more open platform for alternative book files, reader-dedicated android apps, etc...) is not just a different category, it is the replacement of the static black/white screen.  Amazon will need to catch up quick.",0,0,0,1,0204,1,1,Ron Cronovich,"T Madsen, thanks for your review of the Nook Color.  It sounds like a great device.  I love the touch-screen of my ipod touch, so I can see how it would be easy to love the touchscreen interface of the Nook Color.  I absolutely agree that magazines like National Geographic which have gorgeous photos or graphics would be wasted on an e-ink based reader.   And of course, the Nook Color's web browser is quite good, and makes Kindle's web browser look even more inadequate.    Tablet computers like Nook Color may eventually dominate the ereader market, as you suggest.  But I think there's still a market for e-ink based Kindles, at least for the foreseeable future:  They still work great for reading novels and most non-fiction books, they're about half the weight of Nook Color, they get really great battery life, and they cost about $120 less than the Nook Color (when you include sales tax on the Nook Color).   Maybe I'll pick up a Nook Color when my finances recover from the Macbook Air I just bought (that will take quite a long time, unfortunately).  Until then, I'm happy that it's such a great device for you and others who buy it.  Having more choices is better for us consumers, and healthy competition will motivate both companies to keep improving their products.",0,0,0,1,0205,1,1,Ron Cronovich,"S. Sokolinsky:  I know people who buy every new ipod model that's introduced.  E-readers aren't as sexy, but is it really so inconceivable that someone would buy new models frequently, just for the sake of having the latest and greatest?   Yet, that is not our story.  We have two, not five or six.  You want to understand why, so here's why:  Last summer, I bought a Nook and my wife bought a Kindle 2.  We fully intended to keep them for years.  After using my Nook and seeing my wife's K2, I grew to strongly prefer the K2, so I returned my Nook.    Instead of ordering a K2 for myself, I ordered a DX.  It was a lot more expensive, but it had a new kind of e-ink technology with 50% better contrast than the K2, and of course a bigger display.  I fully intended to keep the DX.  But the day it arrived (literally!), Amazon announced the new Kindle 3.  The screen of Kindle 3 wasn't as big as the DX, but Kindle 3 had the same new high-constrast e-ink of the DX and it was $200 cheaper.  K3 made me regret my DX purchase.   I called Amazon customer service to discuss these issues.  I said I didn't want to abuse their return policy, but I also didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on devices that were immediately obsolete.  They told us to return our kindles within 4 weeks and put us on the pre-order list for new K3s.  They said don't worry, this is normal whenever a new model comes out, everyone who just bought the old model and is still within the return period wants to exchange it for the new model.  They factor these returns into the cost of coming out with a new version.   I promise you:  every time I purchased one of these e-readers, I had every intention of keeping it.  In 12 years of shopping at Amazon, I have bought well over 1000 items and returned maybe 5 or 6 of them (including 2 or 3 that were defective).  We have had our K3s for over 3 months now, and are very happy with them.  We will keep them for a few years.    Or maybe we'll get into the habit of buying the new model every year.  If so, then next year you can look forward to seeing my review comparing the Kindle 4 to the Kindle 3.",0,0,1,1,0206,1,1,Arts&HistoryFan,"Ron,    I just wanted to say I love your last sentence!

A great number of us (which I link to elsewhere) feel the DX is fantastic for textbooks but then we know how to use it for that, as I mentioned.  I followed the campus projects  closely.    Mobileread forums are full of people who are agog over the DX and they are very heavily technical and tend to be academic but also technically adept in trying out features of this larger e-reader.    The most egregious report was from the Princeton newspaper, in which they had a professor who did not want to have the Kindle in his classroom but he acquiesced and then did not let the students use the location numbers to reference a paragraph, even though the entire class was a Kindle class.    Then they had about 4 quotes that were negative.  This was repeated in a few hundred other newspapers for a couple of months and each time it referred to ""many students"" being negative but what was not pointed out was that 3 of the four negative quotes  were from the same student.    That form of ""many students"" had a huge life in newspaper reports.       It is definite that the lawsuit against the Arizona college for not having audio-menu navigation for the visually impaired was the big stopper.  Federal funds would not be available to any college who used the Kindle as it was during the evaluation process.   But there was also the feedback from a majority of students who did not like the keyboard (nor do I); however, that doesn't mean it's not good for reading textbooks.       If someone asks if it's good for note-taking, no, it's too slow, though I do it.   I am unusually patient though with that kind of thing.  I would prefer a real touch keyboard somehow.  I too use a small netbook for heavy typing, but that DX is with me if I need to read reference books with diagrams, etc.    That page 'flipping' thing and what some students ""were used to"" and didn't find substitutes for tended to be because they didn't know what to substitute for their previous procedures and didn't seem very exploratory.       The Collection features do make a big difference but then so does the pan and zoom for PDFs though it is not nearly as smooth as with the $500 minimum iPad.   We are answering this question in the real world.      You and I agree that the 6"" e-readers are non-starters for textbooks and focused use of PDFs, due to size problems and also because color is needed for courses in biology or for any books for which color illustrations are key.       However, I feel that the DX price has to come down, so I would wait for that, though there is a 30-day full-refund period for any reason whatsoever.",0,0,0,1,0238,1,0,Thelma E.

You wrote, ""Part of me wishes I'd bought the 3G model, because the browser is good enough that having lifetime free 3G wireless would be worth the extra money."" At my work the IT department blocks any sports websites, and there is not any wifi there, I'm wondering if you think the Kindle 3G browser would allow me to listen to baseball games through mlb.com? Of course, the main reason I'd buy the Kindle would be for my love of reading, but this could be an extra bonus and a work-around  Big Brother. I'm sure if I spent $500 on a new iPad, it would easily accommodate my request, but it would be cool to spend an extra $60 on the Kindle and get a two-fer.Thanks.",0,0,1,0,0279,2,1,John Pedrick,"Thanks very much for the review.

This is exactly the conclusion I came to. I have an iPhone and Mac already. I don't need an iPad. Mac may even come out with an iPad mini by next year April/June 2011. The Kindle WiFi extra is ok; however convenient. For me the basic eReader is good enough, and as you mentioned all the books are downloaded already. You don't have to worry about wifi connections or downloads that are slow. Even with a 3G iPhone, connections are slow ... still waiting for the 9/10G to come out, maybe in the next decade, it'll be a while before they speed the airwaves up. Internet connection is fine with me to download files. As for WSJ, Financial Times, NY Times and other trade magazines, yes iPad is better. However, I still enjoy reading a magazine/newspaper.

Thanks.",1,0,0,1,0294,2,1,Hzleyes,"Jeffrey, you have generated an incredible amount of email thread based on this review. You should blog it and link it as a free download on Kindle. I settled on the Kindle after testing the Ipad and Nook (the new color). I love Mac products. In fact typing this comment from my macbook pro. I have iMac, iPods et al. That is where the story changes; after careful review of all features in print and sight, I decided on the Kindle with Wifi and 3G. I travel a lot so the 3G is worth it to me. The downloading of books and newspapers is breathtaking in its speed. Light and easy to carry. The iPad has wonderful features but is really heavy in comparison to the Kindle. You can't hold it on one hand. Besides if I want to send an email, I can send it on my phone or computer. LCD, color are great and on the IPad, but not enough to tempt me. On the other hand, I came close to taking the Nook Color. Same size as the Kindle but the LCD screen makes it feel slightly heavier. Great touch features on the LCD screen but I think it will definitely cause problems for long time reading. After 30 mins, my eyes were irritated. Nonetheless, I may get one for the kids as a Xmas gift. The Kindle is way to slow and boring for their need for speed and flash. Great review.",1,0,0,1,0295,2,0,John E. Carpenter,Very good review!

This is my first e-reader. I'm a bed-time reader with physical limitations which make it painful to hold anything heavier than a paper back. I could never get comfortable with paper backs unless I laid on my back and read. The Kindle is easy to hold or even prop against another pillow while laying on my side. I love the page saving feature that never loses the last page read. No more fumbling to find that anymore.  The automatic shut off saves battery life. I'm down to 50% after 8 nights. The dictionary is an additional boon. It allows me to highlight and save the text, which I can later review under 'My Clippings' by selecting the 'Home' key. For night-time readers the text is easy to read if you have an attached light. I purchased the Belkin light. It has two settings and takes 3AAA batteries. I am using the lower setting and have used it for 8 days, leaving it on all night; so far, the batteries are doing great. The base of the light slides around a bit but I attached it to the Kindle with Velcro which solved the problem. The light itself has a 7"" flexible neck which allows you to (re)position it as desired to avoid any glare.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y27P3M"">Kindle Wireless Reading Device, Wi-Fi, Graphite, 6"" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology</a>",0,0,0,1,0297,2,0,tls5088,"Thanks, almost no one refers to my biggest challenge with the Kindle -- the search & sort features.  If you are an avid reader, have caught up with your favorite authors' latest publications, you will have to move to a PDA or computer to do a ""real"" search.  The pages are unbelievably slow -- reminding me of the days we only had dial-up -- and, as you mentioned, very frustrating.  I was really disappointed that these issues were not addressed with the newest edtion of Kindle.  With that said, I want the best READING EXPERIENCE.  I bought the Kindle to replace my books, not as a second computer, iPad, Blackberry, etc., but certainly understand others desire for those features. Based on these factors, I want to quickly and easily search for new books and authors; adjust the sorting for my ""wish list"" for ideas; view ""similar"" books or authors; and see the ranking/rating, publication date, etc.  Who knew it would be so difficult to remember if you've read an ealier edition (8 years ago) or find out the ""real"" publication date to ensure you have the first book in a series.  It seems most publication dates on the Kindle are not related to the actual first edition of the orginal book rather when it was an e-book, or a reprint, or just when Kindle loaded the book onto their system.    In short, I appreciate you touching on the search/sort functions.  Possibly others will provide comparison reviews related to these elements.",1,0,0,1,0298,2,0,Astronomy buff,"Good thorough review.

Some programs are available only in a video format. The new iPod doesn't even allow video files to be loaded on it, so the option of listening to them is lost.   As for your laughing at the loss of the camera, I actually use that, too. But you're missing the point. Anyone who wanted to listen to music ""undisturbed"" on the older iPod could do so. All they'd have to do is not use the camera.   You've got your facts wrong. The new iPod doesn't have more memory than the old one. They both come in 8GB and 16GB. If it's ""all about song storage,"" you can't store more songs on the new model. I have to wonder why you'd get such a basic fact incorrect. Moreover, what kind of ""true music lover"" needs to have 2,000 to 4,000 songs on an iPod? And if you want that many songs, you'd do well having the larger screen of the older nano, so you can navigate through thousands of songs much more quickly and easily. But maybe you think navigating through thousands of songs on a very small screen is not disturbing. :-)  A true music lover, who didn't want any ""disturbances"" on her iPod, would do quite well with a 2GB player (500 songs, or over 24 hours of music), with a display for navigation, that cost about $50. With the money you save, you could buy a lot more music. :-) LOL right back to you!   The worst part of it is that you seem very happy to pay more for less. Yes, I can understand that you don't care about being able to watch or listen to video files, and you don't care about taking pictures or movies. But why on earth are you HAPPY to pay MORE for less?

That may be true, Stef, but it's completely besides the point. The point is, with the latest model, we were paying more for less, at least until Apple got wise to what was going on and jacked up the price for 5th gen iPods.   But like a good little Apple groupie, you solve the problem by purchasing yet another Apple product - an iPhone. And others solve it by purchasing an iTouch, or an iPad. And that's exactly what Apple wants you to do.  Apple designed, manufactured, and sold a perfectly good nano - the 5th gen - that could not only play music and had a decent size display for human eyes and easy-to-use controls to navigate through all your stuff, it could also play video files, take pictures and movies, and record sound. And still it was small enough to slip in your pocket or wear around your neck. And you could get them for as low as $130. Now ""refurbished"" 5th gens cost $200, and new ones cost almost $300. That's the free market for you.  So now we're paying just as much as we used to for something that is not as good, no matter how you slice it. The 6th gen has absolutely NO advantage over the 5th gen. And anybody who says that the smaller size is some kind of advantage is kidding himself. It's not like the 5th gen was big and clunky.   And you know what, Stef? The 5th gen nano had the SAME quality sound and was a GREAT MUSIC PLAYER. Why do people keep saying that about the 6th gen as if it's a better music player than the 5th gen?   I don't mean to sound mad, but I get tired of people who dismiss the ""minority"" of people who play (or listen to) video files. And I get tired of people who are ""much happier"" to pay more for less. And I get tired of people who casually suggest that a ""reasonable"" solution is to buy an iPhone, iTouch, or iPad. People like you are the apple of Apple's eyes.  By the way, Stef, if you own a 5th gen, what was your reason for getting a 6th gen?",0,0,1,1,11339,41,1,STEF,"You are making FAR too many assumptions.    1)  This is a PORTABLE MUSIC PLAYER.  Not needing a camera or video capabilities is EXACTLY the point.  Last time I checked, there were many other products that could play music and video and fit in your pocket - non-Apple products included.  And if I'm not mistaken, most of them have much bigger screens than the Nano 5G.  2)  Apple groupie?  People who enjoy and purchase Apple products are groupies?  I purchased an IRiver mp3 player, does that make me an IRiver groupie?  I purchased a Windows laptop...am I Microsoft groupie too?  I suppose if I would have chosen a Droid I'd be a Verizon groupie...or an EVO would make me a Sprint groupie too (?)    3)  You are very quick to point out that Apple removed the camera and video capabilitites, but you said nothing about adding the Apple dock connector.  How do you know the cost differential between the additions and subtractions don't offset each other?   Since this is a PORTABLE MUSIC PLAYER, the dock connector is much more important to ""hi-fi"" music listeners than any ""non-musical"" functions.    4)  Have you listened to the 5G through an amplifier using the headphone jack vs. the Nano through an amplifier using the dock connector?  Of course not.    So why exactly are you stating that the 5G is as good at playing music as the 6G?  Because you're just another Apple basher making blind assumptions.  5)  You dismiss smaller size as being a benefit.  How's that?  This is a PORTABLE MUSIC PLAYER...that's exactly the point.  With the 5th Gen, I had to keep it in my pocket:  the headphone cord would strangle me at every turn...and I would have to keep taking it out and putting it back in my pocket to use it.  6th gen:  I run the cord through my shirt sleeve and clip the Nano in place...no obstruction or intrusion whatsover.    6)  This was initially designed as a music player...later adding ""bells and whistles"" in attempt of selling more units.  Video is ABSOLUTELY an afterthought - that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone.  I'm neither an Apple supporter nor an Apple basher, I simply buy products that work for me.  I sold my 5G for $80 and purchased a 6G for $130.  It's worth the extra $50 to me.  In your case, I'd honestly recommend a Droid.",0,0,1,1,11340,41,0,Steven Mason,"Apple groupie?  For Pete's sake, that isn't an assumption, it's a joke. I think I can safely ""assume"" that you know what a real groupie is. My point is that your ""solution"" of buying an iPhone is not reasonable. You totally ignore the point and focus on a silly joke, pretending to be hurt.   ""You are very quick to point out that Apple removed the camera and video capabilitites, but you said nothing about adding the Apple dock connector.""  Yeah, right, like the other nanos didn't have dock connectors and that's why they had to take the other features away. I'm an engineer and I KNOW what's involved. I've even talked to Apple engineers about blue tooth.     ""Have you listened to the 5G through an amplifier using the headphone jack vs. the Nano through an amplifier using the dock connector?""  As a matter of fact I have hooked up MANY versions of the iPods to MANY hi-fi sound systems. They've been extremely good for events, performances, parties and weddings. But I guess it isn't good enough for you. Do you have a specific complaint about the quality of sound coming out of a 5G? Hey, here's a question for you: Have you watched any videos on an HDTV using that wonderful dock connector on the 6G? I can use my 5G for that.       ""You dismiss smaller size as being a benefit. How's that? This is a PORTABLE MUSIC PLAYER...that's exactly the point.""  Oh, so that's why you bought a 6G when you already had a 5G: You got tired of lugging that brick around? If you think the 5G isn't PORTABLE, I think it's time you hit the gym. That is, if you can manage to find the strength to get to the gym. And speaking of gyms, I've seen plenty of people who clip their 5G nanos. When I run it goes in my pocket. I never have problems with the cord. You must be one of the miniscule percentage of people who has problems with their 5G.    ""This was initially designed as a music player...later adding ""bells and whistles"" in attempt of selling more units.""  I UNDERSTAND that. But what's hard to understand about people not liking to pay more for less? In the opinion of MANY people, the new touchscreen is just too small to be seen as an advantage. And then there are other shortcomings with the 6G that I haven't even mentioned. I'd LOVE it if Apple came out with a basic audio and VIDEO player, about the same size as a 5G, with NO ""bells and whistles,"" that cost $100 (adding video playing capability does NOT make it more expensive for Apple). And I'd LOVE it if, for $25 bucks more, they offered the same with blue tooth. And then maybe, for those who like such things, Apple could offer a model that has a touchscreen for $150. ALL of these models could have a built-in clip, for people like you who apparently don't mind buying iPhones to play video files but do mind buying accessories like clips.   I'm an Apple basher? LOL!

I know those are usually compared to the Touch, but if you're in the market for a Nano, you don't care about the apps or browser.  Off the top of my head, there isn't really anything the Nano does that the Zune can't, except record video (in the case of the 5th gen model).  I test drove both a Zune HD and 3rd gen Touch for a couple weeks trying to decide which one to keep.  I thought the Zune was a much better media player, and loved the form factor.  It was very well built and surprisingly light.  I enjoyed the feel of it much more than my brother's 5th gen Nano.  I never did try bringing it into the gym or anything like that though; I wasn't sure I was going to keep it, so I was careful not to abuse it.  Ultimately I wound up returning both devices, as they were both way more than I needed in a music device.

Rather than being annoyed by the queues or reception rooms or life's other little ""waits,"" I almost look forward to such times; no time is wasted.

I brought it over here because I think it brings up a number of interesting thoughts regarding this.   Hopefully no one takes major offense at my line of reasoning... it's just one man's speculation, nothing to get too jihadi about.   >> Hey Bob, nice review. I think you're largely right in your replication of Apple's reasoning here... but I also think Apple is probably going to end up being wrong in their calculation that the Nano audience is going to be happy being told to ""just go buy a Touch"" if they miss certain features that the new Nano (aka 'Super Shuffle') lacks. Or if they just plain do not dig the very small screen size.   And I say this as someone who *likes* the new Nano/Super Shuffle... a lot. It's very good for its intended use. But not everyone wants a pure 'gym' shuffle, and all those who want something else don't automatically want a Touch, either. Those ppl are now pretty unhappy.  Worse, this move leaves a significant hole in Apple's line-up, which no doubt Microsoft, Sansa, and the rest will attempt to exploit. Again, some ppl *do* want a relatively full-featured player that's significantly smaller than a Touch, and which can pull double-duty as being both a gym-player and a cool 'media' player to have anywhere else as well.  Sure, one could easily argue that such a player is 'jack of all trades, master of none', and there's some truth to that... but that doesn't stop a significant segment of the market from still wanting one- especially if they've owned Nanos in the past. And those ppl will vote with their wallets.   Consider too that if you're one of the ppl who never watched video on their Nanos because you thought even the 5th gen screen was too small... how much more screen real estate could Apple have gained by keeping the overall size similar (maybe a bit wider and shorter), ditching the clickwheel, and making the entire front a touchscreen? Realistically, quite a bit more screen could've been had, and I think that's what 5th gen Nano fans were hoping for/anticipating. Boy, were they surprised... hence some of the angry comments and reviews. =  I myself am a hardcore *Apple* fan, not a hardcore *Nano* fan, but I can understand where the Nano fans are coming from.  The annoying thing is, we WILL probably see such a 'true' Nano touchscreen player before too long... from one of Apple's competitors. =[  Which highlights the real head-scratcher in all this for me- that this really didn't have to be an 'either/or' choice from Apple. They could've made Super Shuffles AND MultiTouch 'true' Nanos, and both would've sold very well... while leaving zero daylight for the competition.  Thus, the only rationale I can think of for diverting from such a strong strategy/iPod line-up and leaving such a hole is that Apple wanted to push (shove?) the Nano crowd towards the Touch, both for the higher ASP (average selling price) and, perhaps more importantly, because this makes more people into 'apps' buyers... which in turn attracts developers and helps push the entire iPhone/iTouch platform.   This ends up being a 'snowball effect': More apps buyers = more developers = more apps = more reason to purchase an iPhone/iPod Touch = more iPhone/iPod Touch buyers = more apps bought = more devs = more apps = more reason to buy an iPhone/iPod Touch..., etc. etc. It's a pretty awesome feedback loop of *cha-ching!* for Apple. But that's no comfort to former Nano fans, who loved the prior form factor and feature set.  Thus, I predict there's going to be quite a run on 5th gen Nanos. And after those are gone, the Nano crowd is likely up for grabs.  Apple will probably convert many into Touch users, but they may lose more than they banked on as well.  An accompanying reason might be that Apple is just really into a device being perfect for its intended function, and the old Nano didn't really meet that standard.

But in the end, they're just that... an opinion. You have yours, and others have theirs.  In yours, you got mad when you saw Apple adding features to the Nano with the 3G, 4G, and 5G models. However, many other folks would disagree, and actually liked those changes. The Nano line has certainly never lacked for sales, in any of its iterations.  The funny thing is that you flame me and take me to task as if I was some sort of 'champion' of  those added features. Re-read my review carefully and you'll see that I'm actually not... I simply state where fans of the previous gen Nano stand on the issue. It's called providing context.  *My* review, if you bother to actually read it, judges the 6G Nano on its own merits in the role Apple has assigned to it... that of a 'gym'/workout music player. And the things it gets dinged on are not that it's not a 5G, but rather the ways it falls down on the job as said gym/workout player, plus the value-for-money proposition.   Some of your comments are quite curious, though. Why would you ""laugh your ass off"" at someone taking a picture with their mp3 player? I don't use any of mine for that, but some ppl do. Did you also ""laugh your ass off"" at ppl when they first started to take pictures with their flip cameraphones? Do you currently laugh your ass off at ppl taking pictures with their iPod Touchs? If so, I bet you get a lot of funny looks. ;)   As far as sound quality goes, you do realize of course that 90-95% of iPod users just use the stock headphones or similar, and never plug a headphone amp into the dock connector, the 'big feature' you're so head over heels about, right? Just another case of someone thinking that THEIR usage pattern is only valid one, I guess.  And your final comment- ""If you actually had a clue about what you were reviewing you would have at least given it 4 stars""- is quite silly. Nearly 50% of Amazon Nano reviewers (over 200 reviewers) have given the 6G Nano three stars or less. But all those ppl ""don't have a clue"" because their opinion does not match up with that of the lone, self-annoited expert? Wow. Good luck with that.   While zealotry can be fun (and I've been guilty of it myself from time to time), being dismissive of large numbers of ppl for simply having different opinions/tastes/usage patterns ultimately says more about the dismisser than those dismissed.  Enjoy your nano John, and get the new 1.1 Software Update for it. It addresses a couple of significant issues that 'those without a clue' pointed out repeatedly.

In many ways, I want this thing.  But the comment above is a deal-breaker.  I have a 5th Gen NANO and several lovely Shuffles.  All I really want from the device is audio (including the radio) and the ability to navigate in it.  I love the Shuffle-like form factor.  On the surface, this would appear to be my ultimate device.  BUT...I never use my 5th Gen NANO.  And the reason is that it is ~always~ out of battery.  No matter how careful I try to be the thing seems to defeat me.  For me, it was a complete waste of a lot of money.  I've read the manual for this one and their ""intelligent"" power management sounds good.

Just because you're used to the click wheel doesn't mean that the buttons on the touchscreen will not appear on the same quadrant of the Nano as they always do... you just have to get used to it.  Aside from the fact that the item is overpriced, your criticism is unfounded.  Why would physical buttons for volume be harder to use than the click wheel?  In my opinion (and most others) a physical volume button is easier to use than adjusting to the click wheel.  Please do me a favor and re-asses this product once you get used to its features, because your negative comments seem like they'd be positive changes to me.

It's a given that this item is solid to the touch and will endure the test of time.",0,1,0,1,01409,45,1,Peter Hunt,"I don't want to appear argumentative, but let me reply at length, since I think I probably wasn't clear enough in my original review about my main criticism of the new nano. I don't expect or hope to convince anyone of anything; I just want to state my opinion more clearly.  I agree that if you're sitting on your sofa at home, or standing on the train, or walking down the street, that the new controls for the nano are just fine. If you can stop to find the buttons or use the touch screen to adjust the volume or find the next song, then cool.  But to me, and to other reviewers I've read, the appeal of the nano has always been in its portability. Based on the reduction in size and the new clip on the back of this model, Apple are clearly positioning this product as an ""mp3 player when you're on the go"". It's the player you use for running, cycling or even if you're just working on the house or the garden.  And this is where I think the loss of the click wheel hurts the product. With the click wheel, you can adjust the volume, seek within a track, or skip to the next or previous tracks, without looking at the device. That's handy when you're running, cycling, driving or concentrating on anything visual.  With the touch screen, having to stop and look at the product while making these adjustments is more cumbersome. It's not the end of the world, but it's simply not as convenient as the click wheel on the previous product. Even when adjusting the volume, the click-wheel is easier to find and use than struggling with two small buttons on the edge of the nano.  This isn't my bias in favour of the click wheel, it's my evaluation of the effectiveness of the new design when using the product in the situations it's been designed for.  Finally, let me just say that I like Apple's products a lot, and I am always excited to see what they come up with. They've done an amazing job in reducing the size of this device, and in putting a touch screen on something so small and still making it usable. The three stars I gave the new nano are three full stars. It's still a pretty good mp3 player.  The trouble I see is that given how Apple are positioning the nano, I don't think a touch screen benefits the device's purpose, no matter how beautifully engineered it is. The click wheel was a better tool for the job.",0,0,0,1,01410,45,0.90909094,J.

I have a Toshiba that drops into sleep mode when not in use and a Passport that does not (both are NTFS formatted, so apparently the 'sleep' feature on the Toshiba is handled by either hardware or firmware (which are not changed by reformatting), not handled by software (which would be wiped out by a reformat).

However, comparing an entry level amateur camera to a professional-grade D700 seems wrong. Before I proceed, I am adding that I do have a D700 and FX lenses to match.  I can agree that under good lighting conditions, and using a similar lens (and aperture) both camera's could come up with a similar looking photograph. However, I think, similarities end about there. Now, we are talking about two entirely different classes of cameras.   One (D3100) is an entry level amateur camera meant as a basic DSLR. The other (D700) is a full professional equipment, which costs about 8 times the other (when taking an appropriate lens into account. I am taking a 70-200f2.8 as an example lens). A basic setup of a D700 with a 70-200 f2.8 lens (or a 24-70 f2.8 lens) would cost about 5000 USD.   - D700 feels and operates on a different level than amateur cameras. The first time you hold it in your hand and use it, it feels like a professional equipment, not an amateur toy.  - D700 has amazingly low noise. When light is ample (day time), I prefer to use 200 iso and not 100. At 200, you cannot detect any noise visually in the D700. At 1600 iso, the colors and noise level of the D700 are still aesthetically pleasing.  - D700 has a body of a tank, and fits the higher profile professional FX lenses like nikon 70-200 f2.8 perfectly.  - D700 has features like frame-burst of 8fps, intervalometer etc. which are not to be found in the amateur range.  I am sure that what are saying is that D3100 is a decent camera, and will fit the bill for most people.

Clever image processing in the camera is limited in it's scope to RAW->JPG conversion. Even in it's dreams, it cannot aesthetically match a human being controlling the conversion with professional software like Photoshop CS5 or Lightroom.

As you say, the D3100 (like the other small-body Nikons in the D40 family) can't autofocus with really older lenses, i.e. those made before about 2003 that do not have an AF motor in the lens itself. However, I presume the D3100 does have an electronic rangefinder in the viewfinder, like the D60 and D3000, that works very well with those older lenses. I am not speaking of the simple focus confirmation light way over on the bottom left that's in all Nikon DSLRs, which is sometimes CALLED an ""electronic rangefinder"" (causing some confusion), but an actual rangefinder scale that shows when you are approaching or passing correct focus.

Yes, the 18-105mm VR does have some barrel distortion at the short end (as most zoom lenses do) and mild pincushion distortion at most other focal lengths. The fact is that for most subjects, i.e. subjects that DON'T have long straight lines near the edges of the picture, you will never notice this distortion. And anyway where it is noticeable it can easily be corrected, either automatically in-camera if your Nikon has that feature, or afterward in software. It really isn't anything to worry about. And the 18-105 is a SUPERB lens as far as definition and contrast are concerned, which is far more important than the modest amount of distortion.

Whether they will AUTOFOCUS on it depends on whether they have an AF motor built in, since the D3100 (like other small-body Nikons in the D40 family but unlike your D50) does not have an AF motor in the camera body itself.  If your lenses are Nikon products put on the market since about 2003, they are almost certainly AF-S lenses and will work fine in every way on the D3100. (But note that some Nikon lenses still being sold brand new are actually pre-2003 models.)  If it says ""AF-S"" and/or ""SWM"" somewhere on the lens it will work fine. Older Nikon lenses and some third-party lenses would have to be focused manually, but apart from that should work just fine.   Another way to tell is to take off the rear lens cap and count the contacts. If there are only five contacts the lens does not have a built-in motor and would have to be focused manually on the D3100.

Many users and especially beginners will not need those extra capabilities, and those people are the intended market for the D3100 et al.

I'm afraid I'm just one of those sappy people who accumulates a lot of stuff they don't actually need. I expect I'll sell off at least one or two of these Nikons, my D40 and maybe my D60. I'll keep at least one small-body Nikon, the D3000 (almost the same as the D3100 in most respects). My others are the D70s (my very first Nikon DSLR), the D80 that followed it, the D200 (which I never use, but I got it at a very good closeout price and it's so nifty I'll just keep it in my collection) and finally the D90. Eventually I'll get the new D7000 also, but not till it's about to be replaced with the next model and the price has come down -- probably about two years from now. That's when I prefer to buy cameras, when the next model is about due. I doubt the D90 price will fall much lower; in fact it has been creeping up a bit since I got mine here on Amazon. The price changes almost daily. Today I see it (body only) is $773.95 here, which is about a dollar more than I paid for mine in early April.   I have quite a few of the Nikon lenses, including the 18-200mm VR you're asking about. It is really a great all-in-one lens, though it's not the sharpest Nikon lens by any means and I think the Tamron 18-270mm VC lens (which I also have) is actually a bit better, especially at the long end. One of the *best* lenses though is Nikon's 18-105mm VR which is the usual kit lens you get with a D90 when you buy the camera with lens. Obviously it doesn't have the zoom range of either the Nikon 18-200 or the Tamron 18-270, but overall it is sharper than either. And it's a lot less expensive than either, especially if bought with the camera. It does not have some of the deluxe features of the Nikon 18-200; for example it does not have the distance scale window and it has a plastic lens mount instead of metal, which annoys some people. I've used Nikon's kit lenses with plastic mount on all my cameras and never had any fail me yet -- I suspect it's just that some buyers like the idea of a metal mount more than plastic. In any case, the 18-105 VR is a great lens at a great price. Nikon's 18-135mm lens is also excellent, not quite the equal of the 18-105  perhaps but close, however it does not have VR.

One thing I didn't mention about the Nikon 18-200 is that like some other long zooms it evidently has ""zoom creep"" which annoys some users -- i.e., if the camera is carried lens down as it would be when carried slung around one's neck or shoulder by the strap, the weight of the front end tends to make it slide out toward the 200mm end. I have actually never had this problem myself, perhaps because I just haven't carried it very far that way. Anyway I understand the latest version of this lens has a lock to prevent it doing this.

The new version with zoom lock is indeed called ""18-200mm (etc., etc.) VR II."" However, my earlier version without lock also has VR II, the ""II"" in this case referring to the more advanced type of VR used on their more expensive lenses, which all the 18-200mm lenses have. So the II may refer to either the type of VR, or the lens version. As far as I can tell, where you see VR II in the lens description itself it refers to the latest version of lens. Another way you can tell probably is by the color of the ""VR"" on the lens. Nikon always used to fill the ""VR"" on their VR lenses with red paint, but a year or two ago they started making the ""VR"" in gold. So if the lens has ""VR"" in gold it should be the latest type with the zoom lock.

THANKS DARLA,0,0,1,1,01586,55,1,Neil H.,"Darla, didn't your D3100 come with the 18-55 VR kit lens? That's the way it's usually sold; at least I've never seen it sold just the body alone, though it is possible some dealers might sell it that way.  If you do already have the excellent 18-55 VR, then the 70-300 VR is a fine choice for a second lens. If you DON'T have the 18-55, but only the 70-300, that is not a very good situation since you almost certainly would want something shorter for wide-angle, ""normal"" and short tele use -- which is what the 18-55 would be for.  Incidentally, when you speak of the 70-300 I assume you're talking about the Nikon 70-300mm VR lens. There are many other brands of 70-300mm lenses, as well as older Nikon 70-300 lenses that do not have VR.   Please advise what exactly it is you have. And if you DON'T have the 18-55 VR kit lens that normally comes with that camera, I would be curious to know why.  The 18-200 VR is a very good all-in-one lens, though more expensive than the 70-300 and generally not quite as sharp, though most users find it plenty sharp enough. If you feel you must have only the one lens for your camera (because you hate changing lenses or carrying a second lens), then yes, the Nikon 18-200 is your best choice among Nikon brand lenses. If you don't mind stepping outside the Nikon brand, I would recommend the Tamron 18-270 VC (in Tamronspeak, VC is the same thing as what Nikon calls VR). I have both lenses and am well satisfied with both, but published lens tests have shown the Tamron 18-270 to be sharper, especially at the long end -- and it's cheaper, too. There are pluses and minuses to both, but you wouldn't go wrong with either lens.",0,0,1,1,01587,55,0,gguess,"Zoom lenses are never as sharp as fixed lenses, and the quality decreases as the use (age) increases.

Thansk,0,0,1,1,01590,55,0,Neil H.,"OK. Darla, since you already have the 18-55 VR, which is an excellent lens, if I were you I would return the 70-300 and hold off on buying a second lens until you have a clearer idea of what exactly you need. Or if you have the urge to buy a second lens right away anyway, consider the 55-200 VR which is also an excellent lens and goes very well with the 18-55 you already have (since it starts at 55mm and therefore ""picks up where the 18-55 leaves off"" so to speak), and is much less expensive than the 70-300, as well as being lighter and more compact. Those are the two lenses I usually carry when I'm taking one of my own small-body Nikons, the 18-55 VR and the 55-200 VR. That makes a nice, small lightweight kit.  The 70-300 VR is an excellent lens itself, but bigger, heavier, more expensive than the 55-200 and I question whether you really need a lens that long. It's intended for shooting at long distances, and/or for small subjects such as birds. But even with VR, that long a lens may be difficult for someone to use who isn't fairly experienced in handling a DSLR.  Also, in your description of your 70-300 I notice that you do not mention ""VR."" There are several older Nikon lenses of that zoom range which did NOT have VR (which you absolutely, definitely want!) and also not with autofocus motor built into the lens itself, which means they would NOT autofocus on your D3100. There are in fact so many different Nikon 70-300 lenses being sold used out there, or perhaps in some cases old but ""new"" stock (i.e., never sold before) that the subject is sort of confusing.  Here's how my Nikon 70-300 VR lens is marked on top of the lens barrel just ahead of the mount:  Nikon ED AF-S NIKKOR 70-300mm 1:4.5-5.6 G  VR (in red)  If your lens isn't marked VR then it doesn't have that image-stabilization feature, and that alone is reason for you to return it.  Apart from that: your lens being marked ""G"" means it is an autofocus lens, but if it isn't also marked ""AF-S"" it doesn't have an autofocus motor in the lens itself, but requires an autofocus motor in the camera body. That is something your D3100 (like other small-body DSLRs -- D40, D60 etc.) does not have. So it should autofocus on the larger bodied Nikons that do have the in-body motor (D70, D80, etc., etc.) but not on yours. In that case, if the dealer knew your camera was a D3100 he never should have sold you that lens.  You can also check this by taking off the rear lens cap and counting the number of contacts you see. If there are only five contacts, the lens does NOT have the built-in motor and will not autofocus on your camera. If it has more than that (typically eight or ten) then it does have the built-in motor.",0,0,1,1,01591,55,0,Cody H.

What I was saying is that not all Nikon lenses will, and some Nikon 70-300 lenses will not, because those older lenses do not have the autofocus motor in the lens itself which your D3100 requires.   Now, as for the ""AF 70-200mm 1:2.8 APODG HSM"" you bought, that sounds like a Sigma lens and not a Nikon. That may be OK, but it seems to me like a lot of lens for a small body like the D3100, and I question whether you need that fast a lens. You certainly are ""jumping in with both feet"" as you say.

Karen",1,0,1,1,01602,56,0,Macauley,"Hi Karen, Yes, it's a known glitch of the D3100 firmware that will probably be fixed with the next firmware update. It does it in every mode, even my favorite P(rogram) mode if the AUTO ISO option is enabled in the MENU.   If Auto ISO is selected, it's not that the ISO defaults to 3200, but rather defaults to whatever ISO the camera would have chosen with the flash off. I mostly don't mind that because I've selected a still-clean ISO 800 as my max ISO (camera defaults to 3200) and am okay with the camera using ISO up to 800 for my candid interior shots (less power demand on the flash), but if you do mind it, then you should disable auto ISO under MENU, assign your FN button (below the flash button) to ISO selection, and choose your ISO manually. Remember, this you have to do regardless of the shooting mode you are in (auto, A, P, S etc...)  I leave auto ISO on and only disable it under MENU for shots that require ISO 100 or 200 (real estate shots on a tripod, for example). I use my FN button for white balance since, for me, that's more critical than ISO on modern cameras that have a clean ISO up to iso 800.

Thanks again!",0,0,1,1,01605,56,0,Macauley,"Karen, If you lower the ISO, the camera shutter will have to stay open longer to gather more light; at ISO 800, the camera will have to gather 4 times as much light as it does at ISO 3200, hence the shutter speed is going to be lower (say, 1/8th of a second instead of 1/60th of a second. This is okay for still subjects with the image stabilized lens that comes with the camera; it's not okay with moving subjects. In that case, you should use a faster lens, like the 35mm 1.8 DX. A faster 1.8 aperture will offset the slow shutter speed since it can gather over 3 times as much light as a 5.6 aperture, so you will be back to shooting at a higher shutter speed. Frank",0,0,1,1,01606,56,0,Macauley,"Because of the firmware glitch, the camera does not increase the flash output to allow for a faster shutter speed, but it defaults to what the camera would have selected without the flash.

I like much of what the camera does and don't want to send it back. But I'm wondering if I should have gotten the Canon T2I.  Do you think Nikon will fix this firmware glitch? I just learned that there's been a firmware update... which will be another challenge for a non-techie like me! It doesn't appear, though, from what I've ready that this particular update addresses the problem we're discussing regarding high ISO default in auto flash mode. Sigh. I've long used ""bridge"" cameras and have taken some pretty decent shots for an amateur (even won runner-up in two Fodor's contests!), but this is my first time trying a DSLR and much is new to me. I understand the basics - used an old Minolta 101 years and years ago as a teen-ager, but it was far less complicated!",0,0,1,1,01608,56,0,Macauley,"I tried the Canon T2i and didn't like it. It had all of my beloved canon xsi's faults (see below) and none of its beautiful colors, plus switching from picture mode to movie mode was cumbersome (unlike the D3100, which makes it quick and easy).  Why I don't like the T2i: it's more work. if you enable auto iso, when you take flash shots, it defaults to iso 400, even in bright sunlight. At least the D3100 uses iso 100 in bright sunlight (as it should).  I like slow shutter speed for my interior shots (1/15th or 1/30th of a second with image-stabilized lenses), and can do so with the D3100 in P mode. Not with the Canon, which only does that in A mode (P mode defaults to 1/60th of a second). For my type of flash photography that's not good since my subject will be well lit while the background will be dark. With my D3100 I leave it in P mode, use slow sync flash, and concentrate on composition, which is the stuff that matters (and for which you won runner-up in the Fodor's contests. Congratulations!!!). I was willing to put up with the XSI's quirkiness because I loved the output; not so with the T2i, but that's me.  For me the D3100 gets out of the way better and lets me concentrate on composition.  If it is your first DSLR, I recommend one of the D3100 guides on Amazon (the magic lantern guide to the D3100 or ""Nikon D3100: from snapshots to great shots"" by Jeff Revell. You already have the compositional talent. You just need to master the D3100 way of doing things.  Hope this helps.",0,0,0,1,01609,56,0,KarenB,"Hey, thanks again. Great advice. It's reassuring to hear that the T2i has its own issues. I guess at the under-$1000 price point, none of them are perfect. As a leftie, I thought I'd like the Nikon interface with some of the buttons on the left. Plus I'm not a pixel pusher and was a little concerned about the 18 megapixels in the Canon. So I'm thinking I'll stick with the d3100. I've ordered the Tamron 18-250 lens, which is soon to be discontinued in favor of the newer 18-270. From what I've read, though, the 18-250 is a little better. The Nikon 18-200 is probably a little better yet, but for the difference in price, plus a bit more reach, I decided to try the Tamron. Most of my shots are taken while traveling (recently returned from India - which is a photographer's delight), and I definitely wanted an all-in-one lens solution.   With your tips (and others I've read), I'm hoping to make the most of the d3100's capabilities. And I'll be keeping my fingers crossed that Nikon releases a firmware update to fix the ISO problem.

I was fine with the 6 MP of my beloved Nikon D70.  If you look now, you can buy a D3100 on Amazon and get a $250 discount on a new nikon 18-200! Not sure where you purchased your D3100, but maybe you can return it and place an order on amazon for a D3100 with the nikon 18-200. That will bring down the price of the lens to $450 or so.

As people ask questions I try and figure it out, that is the only way I appear to know what I comment on.  To your first question, I started playing the Audible book, but as soon as I hit the Home button to switch to a book, the audio book is paused.  Now if I chose to load the audio book as part of the MP3 music selection (I assume I'd have to convert the audible audio book to MP3 and move files to the Music folder), I then could listen and read at the same time. Problem is, as noted in my review, once you stop the MP3 and restart, it starts back at the most recently track loaded. There is no pausing the MP3 to play from where you left off.  As far as re-registering, I bought 2 kindles, one for me and one for my wife. Each kindle was registered in my name. All I had to do was log into My Account > My Kindles and de-register one of the devices. Once de-registered, I gave the 2nd kindle to my wife.

When you get the replacement device, then copy the files back. It acts as a USB storage drive for the most part.  2) For any items that you purchased from Amazon, they are backed up/archived. . .this includes any bookmarks and notes you took on amazon purchased items and storied in your Kindle Library on Amazon's site. This also allows you to share the content between multiple devices (kindle, blackberry, iphone, etc) and keep the page numbers synched so regardless of what device you are reading on, it remembers what page you left off at.  Thus, when you get a replacement device it's supposed to download the archived books & notes to the new device, once you register the new device.    Unfortunately, I don't see an easy way to test this to prove exactly how smooth this process will work from one kindle to another.  Another thing to note, is that technology is constantly changing.  If Amazon cannot give me another Kindle 3 as a replacement (I did buy the extended warranty from square-trade), then I look forward to getting the Kindle 4 or 5 by then instead.

Actual coverage area may differ substantially from map graphics, and coverage may be affected by such things as terrain, weather, foliage, buildings and other construction, signal strength and other factors. Amazon does not guarantee coverage.  You may want to contact Kindle support to ask if you find out you don't have good coverage can you return device at their expense.

Your home router will just use ""WPA Personal"" (or WPA2 (maybe even WEP, which isn't all that secure)) and the K3 will be fine with that. I'm sure someone else will come along who can explain the nitty-gritty better than I can, but the reality is that your home router will NOT be using Enterprise, so you're fine. When you get your K3, it'll likely see the network and then just ask for the passkey and you're good to go.

Thanks!,1,0,0,0,0560,12,0,David Rechtshaffen,"Thank you for this very relevant and thorough review.  I'm a PRS-505 owner in the same boat.  However, I'm now aware of the new PRS-350, and PRS-650 and they are also compelling and seemingly worthy updates to the PRS-505 in their own ways.  I assume you've probably read all about those and read the excellent reviews they've received.  Do you think you'd still chose the K3 over the new Sony's?  Most of my books are PDF format or E-pub.  I think the K3 still doesn't handle PDF's well, unlike the Sony which handles them extremely well, and of course ditto for E-pub formatted books.  The K3 is MUCH cheaper than the new Sony's though.  What's your take?",0,0,1,1,0561,12,1,J. Doherty,"David,  You offer some compelling questions... I will try to answer them in turn with the knowledge I have of the PRS-650 since I haven't seen one in the wild and haven't been able to hold one in my own two hands.  K3 vs PRS-650 I was not aware of the upcoming PRS-350 and PRS-650 models at the time I pre-ordered the K3. I only became aware of them recently. It looks as though Sony has used infrared beams to create the touch interface which eliminates the resistive touch screen found on the PRS-600. I can only assume that the screen quality of the PRS-650 will meet or exceed that of the PRS-505. However, I would wait until some models are out in the wild to see how the battery life pans out. The beauty of e-ink displays is that they do not require constant power to run, just power to change the display. In the PRS-650, the same rules apply to the screen, but now the touch infrared sensors will require constant power. This would result in shorter battery life but I'm not sure if Sony beefed up the battery to compensate.  Also... Amazon's library of ebooks is still larger. With the PRS-505, I found it frustrating to search site after site after site to try and find the book I was looking for in eBook format. I almost always found it at Amazon.com (I never actually tried converting from the Amazon format to something the Sony could read, I've read you can).  The Sony solution is altogether more expensive than Amazon's. I would say the PRS-650 is as close as it gets to comparing apples to apples and Sony's solution is expected to be $229 (from what I've read) and their library is more expensive... compared to Amazon's $139 entrance fee and in most cases eBooks from Amazon are cheaper.  PDF and ePub You hit the nail on the head here... if you are partial to PDF and ePub formats then the K3 may not be the device for you. For PDF, the K3 has added the ability to adjust the contrast of the PDF document which is nice and you can search and annotate PDF's as well. Since the PRS-505 had no keyboard/touch screen the search and annotations couldn't be done. The PRS-650 will (more than likely) have this feature. What the K3 lacks in terms of PDF support is PDF reflow and PDF links (i.e. Table of Contents, etc.). For ePub, well, K3 doesn't support ePub. Calibre (software - free) may be able to help you there, it was and still is my best friend when I'm trying to convert content from one eBook format to another. I use it frequently to convert word documents and pdf's to something the K3 can understand if I don't want to go through the Kindle email conversion. (I will say though, the Kindle email conversion can be handy because if I have a friend or family member setup on my approved email list, when they say they want me to read something I just tell them to email it to my @free.kindle.com address and it just shows up on my device... it's kind of handy. I could see it being helpful in an office type setting. I think it's about as close as we'll get to dragging images from one screen to another like they do in the movie Avatar).  So, looking at how you use your PRS-505 currently, I would say you might want to wait for the PRS-650 because of the ePub and PDF limitations of the K3. Personally, I'm happy with my choice of the K3 and don't think I would change my mind and go to a PRS-650 just because of the higher cost. At this point in time the K3 meets my needs as I really don't do that much work in PDF and, if necessary, I convert the PDF's.  But, that's just my $0.02. At the end of the day you have to go with the device that is right for you.  Good luck in your decision!",0,0,1,1,0562,12,0,J. Doherty,"Orion, Thanks for your comments! The price of the PRS-505's were quite high, but it was fairly new technology at the time, we've come a long way. I think $99 will likely be a magical price for a lot of people. $139 isn't far off, but some will likely wait for further decreases. Looking back, $299 was a high admission price for being an early adopter of technology!",0,0,1,1,0563,12,0,J. Doherty,"Debbie,  Thanks for your comments!  Honestly, the fingerprints were the least of the PRS-600's issues. It was the resistive display which had a lot of glare which required constant readjustment of your reading position to eliminate. Then, once you readjust, you still have a screen that lacks contrast (background was darker and text was lighter... the opposite of the way you want things to progress with an eReader!). I used my PRS-600 on a plane once and found myself putting it down 45 mins into my three hour flight... I gave up (That's when it was returned.). I went back to my PRS-505 until my K3 arrived. Honestly, if you are looking to read eBooks from Amazon (or another source with a compatible format) this is the bees knees. I think eReaders touch an interesting part of the market, early adopters of technology who like to read. The only problem with the ""early adopters of technology"" part is that we all want the devices to do things they just aren't capable of yet (or are capable of and the individual manufacturers have made individual decisions to include or exclude certain features in favor of a different feature).

The Kindle would use the page numbers of the version supplied by the publisher, and that would presumably be the most recent hardcover edition. I assume this is how ePub pagination is handled, so this is not really an agonizing dilemma. (It would be possible to use pagination from more than one edition, distinguishing them with italics, etc., were such information ever wanted.)  If the different pagination that sometimes occurs (and it usually doesn't) between different editions (and multiple editions are unusual) were a real ""showstopper"" it would already have made the current hard-copy page citation practice so confusing that it would be more trouble than it's worth -- which is the reverse of the case. It's very useful, and its problems are mere molehills.  For instance, mass market paperbacks are always going to be considerably ""off"" from the pagination of the original editions, but that hasn't been a problem in scholarly citations, which rarely refer to such works (or to book club editions).  ""Or, if it is a ""simple fix,"" it's not going to fix it for everyone.""  Advocates of Kindle pagination haven't made a claim that it would. It's enough that it would fix it for most people, especially for scholars and others engaged in serious writing. (It would also be needed by college students writing papers, which is a market Amazon hopes to penetrate.) Saying, in effect, that a practice is no good for anyone if it isn't perfect for all isn't a good argument, especially when the imperfect system is already doing a satisfactory job in the hard-copy world.

My wife and I each bought a Kindle 3 and have used them heavily since they arrived on August 27, with only one reboot on hers, none on mine.  Before you heed this reviewer's advice and postpone your purchase, scan a few of the 700 reviews here.  The vast majority of Kindle 3 buyers are very, very happy.  Most of the negative reviews are from people who are frustrated with the shipping delays and haven't even received their Kindle yet.    Regarding the case:  If you think it's a ripoff, don't buy it.   There are cheaper cases available, and more will be coming out in time for the Christmas shopping season.  Look at how many cases are available for Kindle 2--probably even more will be available for K3 because K3 will be a bigger seller than K2 (K3 is cheaper and better).  So you won't have to wait long for more inexpensive case options.     Or, you might still consider splurging and buying yourself a nice case.  After all, the Kindle's price has fallen from $259 at the beginning of this year to $139 for the new wi-fi model; the $120 difference is enough to buy a nice case and have plenty left over.",0,1,0,1,0600,17,0.8333333,monakh,"Much as I would hate to admit it, Ron is correct--for the most part.  We are a vocal--though sizeable--minority but it WOULD be unfair to ignore us.  However, if there is a product defect and it is known to affect just a few production units, what do you do?    As of 7pm Eastern on 9/12/2010, here's the breakdown:   160 Reviews with 3 stars or less: 545 Reviews with 4 and 5 stars:  Do you ignore the 108 1 and 2 star reviews out of the above-mentioned 160?  For that matter, do you ignore the total (almost) one-third reviews that are less than favorable?  I do realize, though, as Ron mentioned, that many reviewers are just complaining about not having received their Kindle.  These reviews, in my opinion, should be removed so we can get an accurate picture.  Regardless, you cannot ignore the fact that there is a real problem that is affecting some Kindle shipments adversely.  I will leave it to the consumer to make an informed decision but one thing is for sure, you ARE at risk of receiving a device which has an issue.  Whether you are brave enough to shoulder that risk is a decision that is yours to make.  I want people to make informed decisions and as far as I know, Amazon still hasn't fixed the issue.  There is NOTHING wrong with postponing a purchase.  If anything it pressures Amazon to fix the outstanding issue that much sooner.  In Amazon's defence, they have very good customer service.  Someone called me after reading my comments and tried to fix my issue but wasn't incredibly helpful.  I asked them to push the new firmware to my device, which purportedly fixes the issue, and they said 'sorry, we can't promise that'.  So much for that.  I told them, I don't mind being a beta tester for the firmware fix that they are testing, after all, my device is pretty much unusable to begin with so how much worse can it get? Anyway, that was ten days ago, and still no firmware update has been received on my K3.  As for the case options, well yeah, like I said, we should vote with our wallets and buy the cases we want at a price which makes sense.  The fact that the Kindle is cheaper and leaves you 'plenty to work with' because K2 was 'X' amount is an argument that holds very little value.  It's Moore's Law in technology and economies of scale at work.  Things get better, and cheaper and just because they do, doesn't mean we say, 'Oh see how much more it was yesterday?  Let's use the money to buy a nicer case'.  That's a flawed argument for an opportunity cost that is non-existent.    Anyway, that's my take on it.  To each his own!

I really thought the new iPod touch was IT! But I am really disappointed in the less than 1mp camera. Let me explain. I bought my wife and I old iPhone gen 1 instead of an iPod because of the camera. We have sprint, so we don't use the phones as phones, just iPods...with cameras. That camera is a 1.3 mp. I know that os trivial, and the new touch is much better in every other way, but still. They are unlocked and jbed.  I have since bought an iPad, 3G 64gb and love it...carry it every where. I miss a camera...not for photos of landscapes...I am a photographer and usually have a real camera, but I do like to take shot of products in stores, and receipts, etc. My iPad is jbed also so I can tether the iPhones, but, really, I just leave my iPhone/pod by the bed as a really expensive alarm clock (it interfaces with a cool clock i have that docks the ipod) that I sometimes use for email and internet in my hand when the iPad is downstairs, or I am to tired to hold it up, or it will be too bright. My wife on the other hand uses her iPhone/pod all the time...recording college class lectures and for lite email...and recently words for friends. She is also taking pictures and video all the time. I provide a wifi to her when we are out and about.  Anyway, the point of all this this. Do you think apple will bump the res up on the iPod touch any time soon?   At first, I was going to pre order one right away for her. I think I will hold off for myself. I was thinking I would get two, and I could benefit with the new touch shooting for the iPad but I am thinking that would be too much. The iPad is already on the big side.   But now I wonder if I should wait for even her. I gave her my original wifi iPad, but she did not dig it like I did preferring to still use a laptop (I got the 3G and sold my laptop...gladly!).

That and the Apps link did get me to realize that I can use it for much more than just listening to music.    One item that you did not list as a disappointment but did disappoint me is that the new Touch uses USB 2.0 rather than USB 3.0.

Apple has not officially announced the iPod having 512MB of memory, but there was a recent conversation with an Apple Support personal who confirmed it. Plus, several gadget blogs have had inside sources echo similarly. Wikipedia also reports the 512MB spec, though its source is yet to be confirmed. I suspect the source will end up being iFixit, once they do their teardown and confirm it.   Here's that conversation, by the way: http://bit.ly/ipod4ram  The same employee also outed the vibrator, later confirmed by an FCC teardown. If that's not enough to confirm 512MB ram, consider this: the iPhone 3GS and iPod touch 3rd gen (32GB & 64GB models) shared the same processor: the Arm Cortex A8. Consequently, they also shared the same amount of ram: 256MB. Frankly, it'd be asinine to put an A4 processor in the new iPod touch and keep the memory at a dismal 256MB. That's just laughable. Go ahead... laugh already. :D  Update: The laughing has turned into weeping. iFixit has done their teardown and found the device to be sporting only the same 256MB of ram as the 3g touch. Dang!

The more accurate statement would be: you can't do multitasking AS WELL with 256MB of memory as opposed to 512MB, and only if you're running tons of multitaskable apps in the background (which isn't all that likely).   In iOS 4, memory works like this:  When you hit the home button, apps developed with iOS 3 or older, or set to exit on suspension with iOS 4's SDK are killed right away, and all memory is immediately released for use by other apps. Apps developed with the iOS 4 SDK and set NOT to exit on suspension will remain in memory and run their specified background processes (if any). If and when those processes complete, or if no background processes are specified, the app is then suspended in memory (meaning it can relaunch quickly at the exact state it was in when it was suspended).  Meanwhile, the active app can use use however much memory is available so they can run as efficiently as possible. This means when they hit their limit of free memory and need more (really only possible if tons of apps are backgrounded), one of the apps suspended in memory gets killed. Apple hasn't published any details about how the device determines which app to kill, but I'm thinking it loads a virtual revolver with a single bullet and plays Russian roulette with all the suspended apps until one gets blown to oblivion (and as such, it no longer exists in memory). Just a theory though. ;)  In any case, I figure that a majority of users will never see issues with the 256MB limit.

You're very educated on the subject and I very much appreciate knowing all the goods and bads about the new iTouch (I'm buying a 32GB in a few days).  However, I do not believe your comparison of it to Android is as unbiased as your review of the device itself. Like you, I carry an Android and an iTouch (MyTouch 3g Slide for my Android, 2nd gen on the iPod...as I wanted to wait for this one before upgrading) and I'm on my Android far more than my iTouch. That being said, I think the iOS and Android debate is strictly a matter of opinion. Android lacks the sheer number of apps as the Apple app store and the process is a little more complicated on Android, the Flash support is buggy (but it's getting better) and ""i"" products are dead simple to use for the mainstream user (i.e. my idiot gf can work an iPhone 4g, but my Android runs circles around her). However, the flash does work, even if buggy, and I can't play farmville on an ""i""anything. Android allows the use of SD cards so you can upgrade without having to re-sync all your songs, pics, etc and with Apps2SD now being used on Android 2.2 (where you can install and store apps on the SD card), re-downloading all the apps on an upgraded phone is far less time consuming. Apple is more stable, Android has more options...no hardware keyboard on anything with iOS, half of Android has them...Apple can't tether it's internet connetion to other devices while Androids with 2.1 can (easy tether...free in the app store. It allows free internet tethering on one device, so you don't have to pay Sprint extra money to do it). iOS won't let you share your music with others while you can copy music files right off an Android's SD card and give them to anyone, but Android's music player blows (nearly everyone has a music app who has an Android). iOS has a uniform release date for all ""i""products...Android is all over the place (but I believe they're fixing that, according to many, many rumors).  I say this with all the respect in the world, as you are smarter than most Apple fans, but you cannot compare Android to iOS and come up with a definite winner. It all depends on what you want out of a mobile OS...and since both of us obviously like the features of both, we both own devices that feature both.

I have a palm tx right now, but it is really getting to be on it's last legs.  So my question is, I really like the Palm desktop software that lets you type things into your calendar from the convenience of your laptop and then lets you sync it up to your palm.  You can then obviously take your palm with you and have all of your calendar information with you.  Is there anything that lets you have a desktop ""view"" of your calendar on your laptop and lets you sync up your calendar from the laptop to the ipod touch?

You have a point, and I agree with you--everyone is different. I tend to speak mostly from a software standpoint in my review. The hardware is so different between devices that you can't really use that as a basis for comparison between the two. Nevertheless, I figure even a little bit of comparison may still prove helpful to some.  From a hardware standpoint though, while the SD card support in Android is useful in some respects, I would personally rather have the storage built in, probably because decently sized cards are outrageously priced or non existent (32GB and 64GB respectively). Physical keyboards are nice too, but after two years of using the virtual keyboard on the touch, I'm kinda used to it now. WiFi tethering is a definite plus though.

I was wondering, do you recommend a screen protector for the ipod?",1,0,1,0,0692,19,1,Scott Showalter,"Oops, looks like I forget to mention that one Dorothy.   No, you don't need a screen protector. The iPod touch's screen is made out of glass. Thus, it will not scratch (easily). You could even take a razor blade to it and it probably wouldn't scratch. Even the one I had for two years never had a scratch on the screen. The only scratches were on the chrome (stainless steel) back, which scratches easily, so just make sure you get that silicone skin right away, to protect the back!   Also, I can only imagine that having a screen protector would only hinder the accuracy and smoothness of the touch experience. Screen protectors often feel sticker than the glass feels, so it probably wouldn't be as easy to drag your finger across the screen, use swipe gestures, etc.  Hope that helps.

It's a bit pricey if you ask me, but it has more capacity. I also plan on taking pictures with this iPod until I am able to purchase a new camera.

I guess the major factor here would be the size of your existing music library, and whether you want to transfer the whole thing, or just part of it, to your iPod. The photos aren't going to take up much space at all.   If you aren't going to store any movies on the iPod, and your music collection is less than 32 GB, you may do well with the 32 GB model.

I have my music in Apple Lossless. iLounge had a great review on the new Shuffle, praising its audio quality even with high end earphones. Hopefully someone can shed some light on Touch audio quality.  I think the built-in speaker plays only out of the dock connector slot - at least that's how it seems on my 8gb edition. Am I right? Quality is passable for watching an instructional DVD if I don't want to pull out headphones. I should probably try Skype in speakerphone mode, but I'm curious about your opinion on Skype/speakerphone quality (or Facetime audio quality in speakerphone mode if you have tried it).   Also, it's disappointing that the remote control earphones with built-in microphone I bought for the last generation model won't work on this new model (they will work on the much less useful Shuffle, though - except the microphone of course). That means I get to use/am stuck with whatever quality of microphone Apple included in the case, right? Is that microphone on the REAR of the case next to the camera lens? Looks like it. Does that mean it is optimized for recording audio with the rear facing video camera, and not for use with the front facing video camera with Face Time, Skype, etc. - unless I reverse the unit and talk into the back of it?  My unit gets hot from watching videos. How much heat can the unit stand before it degrades performance? Does adding the typical silicone/rubber case make a difference? I  assume it shuts down rather than self-destructs. [Edit 12-12-10 - I haven't had any overheating from videos any more. The iOS upgrade helped? Isolated problem in one unit (I have 2 now).]  Battery life is terrible under iOS 4.1. I don't mean in actual operation, but in ""standby"" mode. My last gen under the last operating system would last a long time on standby. Neither the new nor the old one last as long under iOS 4.1. I thought this was just a ""bug"" of iOS 4.1 on the last gen, but the new gen isn't any better.  Reading a book under the Kindle app is surprisingly battery intensive, as much so, I think, as watching a video. Maybe anything that requires the screen to be on has the same issue (audio, you can turn off the screen).

I'm the latter type person.  I know much of Netflix's content is still SD but I do see that more of their content, as time passes, is binging offered in HD.  Too, it might be a while before 1080p HD is offered (720p HD is probably what they offer now, as opposed to 480i/p SD), but I have a 1080p HDTV, so why not a Ruko player that has that capability, too?  Not all TV channels broadcast in HD, but a lot do, therefore I have an HDTV.  Would not the same logic apply to the Roku XD or XDS when one has an HDTV?  Anyone with a regular TV would do best to just buy the Roku HD box, since it won't matter much if the content is SD or 720p.

Some reasons (not in any particular order) that led me to buy and use the Kindle (I am quite happy with it):  - I do not want to wait for a laptop to boot every time I want to resume reading - A laptop battery lasts for hours while the Kindle's lasts for days - The Kindle screen has been specifically designed for reading and is completely different (and better for its purpose) from a laptop screen. It does not tire the eyes as a computer does. - The Kindle is small and light enough to be held in one hand just like a pocket book. I can use the Kindle in bed just like I do with a real book. A laptop is comparatively clumsy and difficult to handle. Maybe a tablet computer would be closest to the Kindle, but still very far from it. - Having a book delivered to the Kindle in one minute is very convenient.

I paid $359 for my original 6"" wifi/3g Kindle and $189 for my second 6"" wifi/3g Kindle. I also own the DX which I paid $379. On the other hand I paid $829 for the 64gb iPad 3g/wifi (The 16gb 3g/wifi iPad costs $629). That's quite a price difference between the Kindle and the iPad.  2. Remember, if 3g is important to you, 3g is free on the Kindle. I pay $29.99 for 3g unlimitied data download on the iPad. For the monthly charge of 3g on the iPad you have just paid for the Kindle DX in 13 months.  3. Battery life. The iPad battery life does not come close to the battery life of the Kindle which is handy if you are on a cross country trip.  4. Eye strain is reduced with the Kindle (I read for hours and do not have the eye strain with the Kindle that I do with the Kindle App on my iPad).  5. Device weight.

If you look at the tags at the right column, bottom, you will see that my stories are also often critical of Amazon decisions and I have criticisms of the various Kindles.  I cover some sore points that other bloggers don't.    BUT I continue to really enjoy the Kindle, which is like a very varied window to words and ideas for me - open that window and there is so much to choose from and the study tools are no small reason - I love the annotations and search capabilities and the results and the clarity of most pages this way.   HOWEVER, I have written columns (first one on May 18) which rag on Amazon for not putting full PDF support (annotations) in the DX, and for those in school, Amazon really will have to.  I think it's a matter of getting full licensing from Adobe and adding capabilities in upgrades to the firmware.     Zoom will be crucial in some cases, yes, and while the landscape mode does quite a good job on most things you've noted have clear lettering, as I think my photo page shows (they can be double the size or more in some cases depending on width of a line), there are those for whom that won't do, and you're one of them since your 24"" desktop monitor is barely making it for unclearly scanned documents, not to mention anyone with a 24"" monitor has high standards.    In other words, you'd need a 24"" e-reader screen, which would be a quite unwieldy portable E-Reader, for some of your scanned PDFs.   At 1200 x 834 resolution for the smaller screen of the size we see for the DX, it's obviously quite good for some thiings, but not if your own 24"" screen needs good zooming on it beyond that 24"" capability.

A problem for some with PDFs on any b&w screen with gray scale translation of colors, is that gray shades going from light to dark have a lot of gradations which too often won't have nearly the contrast of color charts.

I would point out a flaw in your description, although I knew what you meant.  And, I would add, if this has been mentioned earlier, I apologize, but I did not take time to read all the comments.  So, you say it is top heavy, but the way you describe it, you have to be wrong.  In the review you say, it is really not that heavy, but it is top heavy.  Top heavy things are bad, since that is usually an unstable configuration, since a heavy base means less chance of tipping over.  Top heavy here meaning the top weighs more than the bottom.

If you go the Amazon forums or to the kindleboards.com forums, you'll see that a lot of people who don't read textbooks love their DX's for the normal fare even though they previously loved reading on their Kindle 2's and still do.    For me, it's much better, though I am only 5'4"" and slight, with thin wrists.  It's not heavy if one has the ability to hold a regular hardcover book for any length of time, but that will vary with the individual.    The clarity is wonderful, as is the ability to handle informational material from anywhere in PDF format so that we can see the originally-intended layout.

I was already hesitant to buy the DX because the idea of emailing 100 MB .pdf files to convert them to the Kindle format doesn't appeal to me.  So not being able to zoom in or increase the font size on the .pdf kind of kills my whole reason for wanting the DX in the first place.

There is no SD card on the K2/DX, but you can manage your library with your computer without a problem.

This obviously wont work for PDFs that you load through your computer and such, but anything you bought from Amazon you can redownload whenever you like.  2.  I think the read aloud feature is more of a gimick than a great feature.  I mean it works, but I find it rather useless myself.  3.  On the read aloud it will read captions below pictures and will get confused as to what is ""next"" on complicated formats, it works best with novel type text.  4.

I personally can't stand zooming in on the pc to see bits and pieces of the screen.  Amazon has a 30-day return policy, and they don't care what your reason is.  You can return it just for not liking it enough as Susan did.    But I happen to love the display on this device.  It's true of many of us on kindleboards.com and the Amazon forums.  Am under 5'4"" and am thin wristed.  But the unit doesn't bother me at all as far as weight.      The width that the landscape mode is on the DX, the original size of the document is quite well approximated.    Some of us really need to read PDFs and there is no alternative right now that isn't far more expensive.  And I find the unit really quite beautiful in the presentation of a page.    You can see some photos at www.pbase.com/andrys/kindleplus I choose to carry it around when out because it is a really excellent display even though I have the smaller Kindle.       Besides, all you have to do is keep the PDF as reference for the layout and then convert a copy in 3 minutes with either the free mobipocket creator or Stanza into a 'mobi' file (Kindle format - which was the former more-open format).     And if you don't want to do the conversion you can send it to your [you]@free.kindle.com and put ""Convert"" on the Subject line and Amazon will send a link to the converted copy back to your email  address normally used for correspondence or orders with Amazon,  converted at no cost.    Then the text reflows to fit the device size and while the layout is not true to the original, you still have the original to check against and you can enlarge the fonts on this copy all you want.

Most of us on the forums who initially regretted lack of zoom on PDFs came rather quickly to love the DX regardless and we don't touch our K2's much anymore and feel bad about that because we were so pleased with them before.  I have scores of PDFs on my DX.     Glad your wife does appreciate your gift, which was very thoughtful! They were never inexpensive gifts.  Especially even half a year ago.    I personally find too much emphasis was put by readers on how awkward it was for one person to hold the DX when used to the K2 -- a hard cover book is FAR harder on any hand.    I do feel a bit bad that people who otherwise want a Kindle for reading actually decide not to even try it because, they say, of one review based on a reaction that is quite individual.  While Susan's is an agonizingly honest review, there are many of us who reacted another way.   I feel strongly as shown by my choosing to carry the DX on vacation instead of my little K2, which is definitely more 'personal' in feel.  Just too pleasant to read on.  That was despite my already bringing my 10"" netbook for work.    Nevertheless, the DX will not be a comfortable size for some people -- I just would not read a post and generalize a point made, to myself.  IF interested in seeing for yourself, Amazon does have that 30-day trial in your home with full refund.    But the big point is that you do want something nigh perfect before spending that much money at all even on a trial basis, and that's the most important thing.  You know what's most important for you and you've gone with your gut feelings - they show what you really want and don't want.  That you're here a lot after deciding against it makes me think sometimes that you're not entirely convinced though and would like to be able to change your mind, maybe.   So I present another side.

That is precious since I find myself switching from one hand to another and clicking accordingly (I am ambidextrous).  I am sure that this is a huge disappointment for left handed individuals. I find this more as a cost reduction.   - With the added weight, it will be very obvious that the left ""next page"" click is missing.  - No folder assortment is just down right silly especially with the number of years they already have in the business.  - Changing the functionality of numbers sounds like a cost issue. Less buttons, less cost. There is more than enough space on a DX to keep the buttons for the numbers. The DX is NOT the size of a cellphone (>.<)  There has to be a more profound reason why someone would want to ""upgrade"" from the K1/K2 to the DX. For the price that they has put on it... it seems like it is not worth it. I'll print the pages that I need from my pdf's for now. It is better than getting frustrated.

There is something quite wrong with it if that's true.    For travel, the DX is what I took when I recently had 3 weeks of vacation and was also bringing a Samsung 10"" netbook, both to go into my backpack for some of the time I was walking.  I used the DX on the various short air flights that the trip included and I generally take it out and about with me even here, where I live, though I sometimes take the little K2 if I want to use a smaller purse.    I am not quite 5'4"" , am female, and am thin, with a small frame and rather bony wrists.  Add that I'm in my 7th decade.  Yet, I have no trouble holding the DX, which is FAR lighter than most books I would carry, especially since I don't have to press it back.  It WILL be too heavy for some, but one should not read and believe it is too heavy for most, as many people who have bought it feel the same way I do and stop using the Kindle 2 much, after getting the DX.    I'm serious that you should call Amazon Kindle customer service, at 866-321-8851 to request a replacement for your DX as in no way should it be less clear than your Kindle 2.  I have a Kindle 2 that is as clear as the Kindle 1 as shown in photo comparisons I've made and which are on my site.    Many found their K1's to be more clear.  Yet the DX is VIVIDly more clear when compared to even my K2.  For examples (including side-by-sides with K2) see my photo series at   - www.pbase.com/andrys/kindleplus    When going back to the K2 I am actually frustrated that the PrevPage is not on the right-hand side at all.  It's what you're used to or prefer.  When I want to have the Prev/Next on the left-hand side of the DX, I turn it upside down.       Really, it's all in what a person prefers - but there is nothing ""too heavy"" for everyone when it comes to the DX or ""too small"" for everyone when it comes to the K2 (though many come to feel that way after using the DX).    And if you're one to get information from the Net in PDF format (many academic and business sites offer information in PDF format, and Google often leads us to them), you'll be glad the screen is that much larger.

I also have a probably unfounded fear that if you use any button too much, it will wear out its function and finally collapse because all springs sag. But with the Kindle 2's two sided controls, you feel you are evenly distributing the use or abuse and extending the life of the controls  two times. All of this may just be baseless fears but then I am totally ignorant of technology and so am afraid. I want to buy the DX, the price is cheap, and I will be able to read the tables that are now too small and obscure in the Kindle 2 as in Reinhardt and Rogoff's expensive kindle edition of This Time is Different on 800 years of financial crisis where I have to skip the tables which are the core of the book and which do not respond to expansion unlike the text. Maybe I will wait the DX out until controls on both sides are restored. Soon I hope.

Can you give more review on how comfortable it is to read scanned book PDF (image files), how about the file size per page?

And sometimes, particularly with scanned items (though again, sometimes not) you not only have the margin, but the entire document has a ""frame"" around it further lessening the page size.  In several cases the end result was type font, in portrait mode, of not more than half the size of the printed page.

Cresci,"First all of, thank you for saving me $500. I cannot personally justify paying that much for a book reader for most of the reasons commented on by other posters. Having said that, I  believed that the power of this device is in the other applications. PDF's are much more powerful than most people know. Embedding video, audio, hot links (both within the document and to webpages) are powerful Acrobat PDF features. Also,the sticky notes, editing features and typewriter tool which allows you to fill out forms are other very important  Adobe Acrobat PDF features.   I feel that Amazon should partner up with the Adobe people and see if Acrobat reader could be included as with the PDF reader function in the Kindle. No matter how wonderful and exciting the technology is, it is just a useless expensive toy if you don;t get to use it all the time. The technology should serve us and make our life easier.  I also wanted to comment about what PDF's actually are and are not.  PDF's can consist of Raster (bitmap) images, objects (vector) , video and audio. When a document is converted into a PDF, the text is outlined - it is made into an object or vector illustration. If you opened a PDF document with Adobe Illustrator, you would see that each letter of the type is an individual object or illustration which you can change any number of ways graphically. However, you cannot click and drag and change the font because the words are no longer type - they are made into  objects by the PDF conversion.  So in kindle you might be able to scale them up or down in size but that is about it. As far as the white margins go. It would seem that the Kindle reader cuts off the actual margin outside of the text frame. If you have white space inside the text frame, the reader probably cannot tell and that would be the reason why sometime the white space is cut and sometimes not. If you made your margins inside the text frame, the reader wouldn't see the margins.   I love the concept of an e-reader. But for $500 it better be a lot more than an electronic toy that allows me to buy books that I cannot share or download non-functional PDF's. This review is not meant as a dis to Amazon for making the Kindle.I think they have a big one up on Sony. If it was reasonable priced, I would have it tomorrow. But for the price, for me, it just needs to do more.

Unfortunately it does have a lot to do with PDF and very little to do with eBook readers (Kindle or others). While PDF is a powerful format for sharing documents among computer users, its original design was never intended to included smaller handheld readers. PDF is not intended to ""reflow"" to fit the display size. Unfortunately to get a true PDF reader, you have to abandon the concept of reading on a handheld. Consider, for example, the large number of PDF documents created for ""side by side"" page display. These documents are never going to work well on a small display where a single page is all that can be reasonably be displayed at one time.  Hopefully Adobe will someday address this shortcoming of the PDF format. In the meantime, the Kindle DX is a fair step in providing users a way to read PDF documents without a larger Laptop computer. Until Adobe addresses the issue of PDF documents.  For myself, what I do with many of my older PDF documents is to dump them to HTML and then re-compile them to Mobi format for reading on my ebook readers (of which the Kindle DX is the latest). This gives me the most flexibility for reading these documents on the small screen, and I can highlight and annotate the Mobi formatted documents on my DX.

Windows and OS X (and presumably any other OS) should recognize the Kindle as a removable drive. Just copy any files to the 'documents' folder on the Kindle, and you will see them along side your books and other documents on the Kindle.  If the files aren't PDFs but they are files that Amazon can convert for you to Kindle-readable format via their e-mail service (e.g., Word .DOC files), send them to your Kindle address @free.kindle.com instead of @kindle.com. Then, after conversion, Amazon will e-mail a Kindle-readable file to you at your registered e-mail address that you can drag and drop to your Kindle's 'documents' folder as described above. If you don't use the free conversion (that is, if you send it to @kindle.com), it will automatically send it to your Kindle via Whispernet, but it will cost you a small fee, currently 15 cents per MB.

I don't imagine that it would bring more than a few bucks, and for that, I'll just hang on to it.

Some genius should have filled this software void by now.  I'm not into online chatting so I literally had no idea that there was not one webcam with mac software other than Apple's, in 2010!  Logitech does have the one Mac camera now but I don't know what the software is like, if there is any and don't know how that camera compares to this one.  I bought this one just in case someone does make software for it the same way Vue Scan has made scanner software bringing to life and restoring millions of dollars on bought pre OSX machines for mac 10.4+ users.  Since Mac is all about graphics I just find this hard to believe, ...we only had an ISight 2003 camera to use?!  Go to YouTube, you'll find a mac user or 2 showing you camera comparisons to ISight.

When I'm on the MacBook (like now) the cam is normally about 10 inches (or less) from my face and aimed over the top of my head. Not a pretty sight. Frankly, if the autofocus on the 910 works and I can adjust the exposure settings with iGlasses (have you tried that?) I should be good to go. That's pretty much how the iSight worked for me, but now I should have a clearer and sharper image for all my admirers (Ha!).",0,0,0,1,0,,,,,,,,,,,,2388,97,0,Qrysta White,"Thank YOU!  I'll have to go grab iGlasses right now to see what that is.  There doesn't seem to be much of a need to do anything to the exposure except I'd say if you have a bright light on one side of your head (and little light on the other side of your noggin') it would be nice to balance that a bit.  My guess though is it takes moving the light source to alleviate the problem vs changing any exposure setting but I'll certainly go see what iGlasses can do.  The one complaint I do see about this camera is that it doesn't have a real clip.  Heaven knows what Logitech was thinking by omitting a good gripping mechanism.  So some with laptops say the thing slides off  too easily and when it comes to lenses they don't take to being dropped too well.  I'm using it on a desktop so it sits pretty without issue.

It does work with this webcam but I think you're better off without it.  There wasn't one setting that made the image better than it was without it.  I do like the mirror image function and the zoom+pan.  Took me a second there to swish hard enough to get the image to pan.  Not worth buying if you have not bought iGlasses and I don't think anyone would bother to use it even if they do own the software already.  I deinstalled it and my image is still not back to being as good as it was.  Hopefully upon restart it'll be fine once again.  A natural appealing bright brilliant image is now too darned dark.  Upon Restsart YEP all is Well.  If iGlasses let us disable its image exposure controls while giving me just pan and zoom I'd be delighted.  I suppose its STANDARD setting is supposed to do just that but it doesn't.  Make a video without it and one with and see how it darkens the heck out of the image.

Any usb webcam that works on a Mac is using usb 2.0 high speed technology and Apple's pretty vanilla UVC - USB Video software.  That software isn't up to date enough give us macites fancy video tools yet.  That's why simple shooting is all we can do.  It is not the camera's fault.  Given that, any webcam software that runs on the apple platform can use the camera you attach.  So if the camera works with one software it works with the rest as they all depend upon UVC.  It works just fine with Skype (which was probably its main app focus), iChat, Photo Booth and new beta Facetime.

I can't see using this w/out a Netflix subscription. (I'm already a Block Buster subscriber too) The most bang for your buck IMO. Netflix doesn't appear to do HD nor give ya 5.1 sound however (<--Strike that last bit. They do have HD titles but Apple TV doesn't identify them. I found that on my PS3 Netflix DOES mark content with an HD stamp. Why Apple TV doesn't I have no idea.) iTunes does give you 720 HD 5.1 titles but then you gotta do it on a ala carte basis and its only a temporary rental. Gotta reign in those iTunes spending binges, otherwise it can be a death of a thousand cuts 2) No 1080i/p resolution. Not an issue on smaller HDTVs but it's a noticeable difference on larger ones.

Yes, you can have multiple different iTunes libraries owned by different people showing up on the new Apple TV.

You can stream movies, tv shows, podcasts, music and photos out of the box.  Makes a great digital picture frame actually.  You put music to slideshows and choose from a handful of effects.  Netflix has search which not many implementations have.  Also has actor/director movie cross-referencing (hit the ""more"" button on a Netflix movie listing.)  My Netflix cover art did take awhile to cache at least once.  Forget if it occurs everytime.  1080p not much of a con when 1080p content  is only found on BR discs and ripped BR discs take up way too many GBs.  A bit ironic it's a con given the reviewer has a 1.5mbps internet connection.  :)  btw, Netflix HD isn't any better than DVD quality really.    Local networks could handle 1080p files better than most internet connections, but still too many wireless networks would sputter and cough when streaming those files (imagine if 2 in the house streamed 1080p?  Not good.)  Plus it would take even longer to cache a 1080p movie which ironically is another con by the reviewer.  The reviewer wants shorter load times, but also wants higher resolution content that would give him longer load times.   Make up your mind.  Besides what really matters is bit rate.  It's a better indicator of picture quality than resolution is.  And let me say no complaints here about picture quality.  Content on ATV looks great!  Haven't experienced the loading screens.  Author wasn't very specific where he saw them.  Netflix is always going to have brief loading screens when accessing the service in a few spots.  I will say Netflix loads too much.  Select a movie to view its description and then go back to your instant queue and you see a loading screen.  The ATV should cache your Netflix instant queue when accessing it, but that doesn't appear the to be the case right now.  Loading screens have been brief to non-existent when streaming media from my computer.  No lag here either on my wireless network.   Probably a fault of the reviewer's network.  Netflix has its own rating system.  I've used 4 implementations of Netflix and none have had Rotten Tomatoes ratings.  And I would say ATV's is the top implementation among the 4 I've used.  Wii has a nice interface, but can only play SD and needs a disc.  360's doesn't have search so far and controls are a bit clumsy with controller.  360 also requires the 360 to be on which is power inefficient and loud and it takes awhile from boot-up to get into the Netflix screen.  No app support is a con?  Not sure how that's a con when no else does apps on their tv device.   The ATV certainly isn't missing a killer app.  Sure there is some potential there, but wake me up when it is realized.  ATV does plenty now.  And I'm sure Apple will update it even if it doesn't become a full-blown app store.  Also Pandora should be under no app support not listed as another con.  I guess it helps pad your con list though.  IR sensor works fine.    The ATV is so small that the line of sight to the sensor can be cut off if you're not paying attention to its placement.  My cons would be no volume on the remote.  I would kill for that.  I rather like the tiny slick aluminum remote, and so it sucks having to keep the beastly tv remote next to me to change volume.  And with today's movies and a wife and kids I have to constantly change volume.  Whispers are too soft and special effects are too loud.  The other con is its a new 1st-gen product type of conduct.  There are a few bugs in the initial release.  No show stoppers given their rare occurence in my experience so far.  But I have had a hiccup with streaming where it doesn't see my computer even though it's on and iTunes is open.      No local storage isn't a con.  First, with the local streaming, there is little to no need to have local storage.  Local streaming is quite responsive.  And with easily installed wired networking technologies out there  like PowerLine and MOCA it only gets better.  Second, local storage would be a hassle with multiple tvs and atvs.  3rd, according to Apple not many want to manage the storage of their own tv shows and movies.

You have to be in a place where there is wifi - bookstore, your place of employment, maybe, McDonald's.  There is free wireless all over the place.  If you want more portability and usability, get a wifi card (like Verizon's MiFi) which will allow you to use a cell phone company's 3G network to get internet access when you are not in an area with free wifi.  Monthly service fees are MUCH cheaper than data plans for smart phone service.  For example, I have a wireless router at home so my whole family has access to the internet in my house.  I also have wireless at the school where I teach.  Most places you might shop (malls, Borders bookstores) have a wifi area and so do a lot of restaurants.  Most of the time, I can get the internet for free.

However, this camera feature was long rumored after 2nd generation ipod touch. Not to mention that the 3rd generation 8gb Ipod touch is basically a rebadged 2nd generation Ipod Touch. Last year's model was a huge disappointment. Therefore, this year, people expected the ipod touch to be a lot better than the previous generation, including a better resolution camera. People expected an ipod touch with a camera in the last generation ipod touch. After being hyped up for so long, people are disappointed that this ipod touch was not a remarkable upgrade, considering that it took Apple two years to develop a camera that had a terrible resolution. I also expected a memory increase, considering the high price, but it did not happen. I think that was why people were disappointed. Apple always touted its products as magical and revolutionary. The ipod nano was worse than the previous generation in the fact that it got rid of video and the camera.  Also, Apple touts this as an awesome camera, which led people to believe that this ipod has a good enough camera to take nice pictures when clearly, it isn't good enough for stills compared to my cell phone. Apple cleverly makes its products sound really awesome, and lures poor unsuspecting people to believe something when it isn't. Steve Jobs during the event praised the camera of the ipod touch, saying it is good to take stills and videos.  I also don't believe ATT pays apple for the full price difference of the iPhone (400 dollar difference) since they subsidize the phone. It is about how much consumers pay and what they get, not what happens behind the scenes between Apple and ATT. Therefore, the consumer technically only spent 200-300 on the iPhone and pays for the data plan.  @ Jen: What about using your cell phone with a better resolution camera? That would probably be a better alternative than your ipod touch, since people always almost remember carrying their phone rather than their ipod touch.  Unfortunately nowadays, Apple has made the decision for the consumer what he/she wants. I am very appalled at Apple for being the only company where consumers would forgive even with their mishaps (iPhone 4 reception). People have been giving Apple too much slack.  Another example is the 13 inch macbook pro. I am utterly disgusted how they still only feature Core 2 Duo processors even though their computers cost 1300 dollars. I could get the Core i7 processor laptop for less than 900 dollars with better specs.  EDIT: I also believe that Apple puts design over hardware/function (look at the iPhone 4 antenna issue, macbook pro 13 inch, the new Apple TV (does not support 1080p when the previous generation did)). I think they are the only company to do that, most other manufacturers prefer hardware/function over design. (Look at Zune HD's Nvidia Tegra, Motorola Droids, etc) I guess it depends on the public, but it seems to me that people prefer design over functionality. Apple has decided to merge almost all their products using their A4 processor (to cut costs, make more profit of their own processor design, but willing to sacrifice some features that were important before). Even with Apple's backwards generation hardware capability, how much do you wanna bet that people still will flock to Apple? As long as Apple keeps everything pretty and small, people will buy it. It feels like Apple is going back into the early 2000's with their G4/G5 processors featured on every computer whereas Intel provided the much superior chip. They seem to be redoing what they did back in the 1990's when they were failing.

I have nothing against Apple, but what I am against is that people are being misled into buying products that cost significantly a lot thinking that they work a million times better. You have no idea how many people have become Apple drones. I just want people to open their eyes to see that there may be other alternatives besides what Apple has to offer for a cheaper price.

They had side by side sample photos and the iPhone takes much sharper pictures. But they said the video HD is quite good!  So all in all I don't see what the big deal is about the rear facing camera. Video is more important to me these days, and it doesn't even have to be HD - 480 is fine.

From what I have been reading and seeing of this product, people will probably flock by the dozens to get this new product, and there may be others who even protest against it. With all of the new specks that apple has put into this product I believe that it is worth the extra money, but there are many people out there that don't care much about the detailed specks because they don't understand them.  The majority of consumers know what they want in a device and they will most likely have to sacrifice one feature for another. They generally don't know what the difference between LCD, LED, or OLED screens. I answer questions about them on a daily basis along with what hz means and ratio means. A lot of people just don't know and don't really care what is inside the device as long as it works the way they want it to.  These type of people just want the best features (that they can see/use) for the price they pay. They don't care much about the internal stuff because of their lack of understanding. They really only care if it works and it's the way they want it to work.  I have a lot of people that come into the store wanting an MP3 player (of any brand) and generally decide on an iPod because of the features it has. In the past year I have had more people get the iPod Nano and iPod Touch than any other type of MP3 player (including the generic MP3 players) because of all the features they have. I high selling point on the Nano was actually the camera and the FM radio.  I don't generally do these posts, but it surely sounded to me like almost everyone here is either spoiled rotten by getting what they want all the time and have a choice to get a new music player whenever they want or they just dislike Apple because of a bad experience or the cost of a product that they ended up not liking. (I'm sorry if I offended anyone.)  I am neither against nor for Apple devices in general, but I do find that the iPod devices are more user friendly for Windows, Mac, or any other computer operating systems and their users. They are easy to update but at the same time, if you purchase a song in iTunes, it is very hard to get it to transfer to another programme such as Windows Media Player and others.  Feel free to comment, I just wanted to share my opinion with everyone that whatever the device may have, people will refuse to buy the product or they will go straight for it.

And of course the iPhone has a much better rear camera, not only capable of much higher resolution for still photography but also capable of autofocus and flash. The built in speaker is capable of 90 db, the Touch can only make it to 78 db. Finally the iPod touch has 1/2 the RAM of the iPhone (256 vs 512).  So the iPod Touch is ""NOT"" an iPhone without the phone.  On the other hand, the iPod Touch is MUCH less expensive than the iPhone (about half the price!), is MUCH thinner and somewhat shorter, and includes most of the feature set - of particular interest to me is the now BUILT-IN microphone, the ""Face Time"" (or Skype video conference) front camera, the rear video camera, the same processor (A4) as the iPad, iPhone, the SAME RESOLUTION as the iPad, the SAME RAM as the iPad (yes the iPad also has 256mb RAM!). And the same improved motion detector.  The resolution is really important, because now it can run ALL THE iPAD apps! That's huge! Download and play video in MUCH better resolution. Netflix stream to it. You can download and view the same video content as the iPad.  What about the lower contrast and lesser viewing angle?  Anandtech is undoubtedly correct in their measurements, and correct in giving the nod to the iPhone in side by side comparison. BUT they say the Asus netbook I own has much better contrast than the HP I also own, and quite frankly as an average viewer there is no noticeable difference. Better is always better, but with my budget constraints I am happy to have the Touch.  So which models to buy? My music collection is 5 gb, with some instructional videos downloaded that's another 3 gb, so right there I can tell I need a at least the 32 gb model, and the 32 gb model would allow me to haul around the UNCOMPRESSED music collection AND still have room left for some videos to go.  There is only a $60 difference between the 8 gb and the 32 gb.  HOWEVER what I mostly use my Touch for is Skype, NY Times stories, USA Today stories, accessing Fidelity Brokerage, web browsing, email checking, Facebook checking. And reading an Amazon book via the Kindle app (I prefer Kindle app to the new Apple app because I can have two Apple accounts but view the book on my old or new Touch - when it arrives - but with Apple I can't log in under two accounts - Amazon will let me download to different devices). These apps and the associated content take very, very little space compared to music and videos. So it looks like I could also get away with an 8 gb Touch if I wanted to - if I selectively downloaded only a few play lists and videos. Thus the 8gb appeals to the minimalist in me. Compared to the last generation, you don't get shafted with a slower processor, and the 8 gb therefore has some potential for gaming, if you play limited numbers of games.  It is hard to justify the 64 gb version. $399 adds up. Although the cost of SSD memory is still expensive.  But I imagine in 2 years these things will be minimum 16gb, 32 gb, and 128 gb.",1,0,0,0,0,,,,952,22,1,Michael King,"Excellent review, but for a media player, you spend no time talking about the actual sound quality of the device...   have they improved the notoriously marginal sound quality on the thing?",0,0,1,0,0,,,,953,22,0,casey,"gas is close to 3 dollars a gallon, going to a restaurant just for 1 meal can easily be 10 to 20 dollars a person, only to be flushed down the toilet.

Not sure what Apple was thinking with such a low res camera. Especially given how nice the other features are.

That would have given them plenty of room to incorporate a 5MP camera and other features. They opted instead to make it smaller and lighter (and very easy to slip out of your hand according to one review I saw) with a thin aluminum backing that is very prone to scratches. It is possible that being so thin at the top limited the type of sensor they could use ... or maybe it was just to prevent any impact to their very profitable iPhone sales.

Re: NEW iPOD Touch Released 2Day, Problem with Statement Made??? . . . Posted: Sep 2, 2010 11:29 AM   in response to: ScottG         Click to reply to this topic  Reply  email  Email  hey forum members, my 1st post!  to begin with, thank you for calling my attention to this question around the outward-facing camera on the new iPOD Touch. the current Apple spec sheet at this time does indeed appear CONFUSING with regard to photo quality, and upon reflection, I decided it must be misstated/misleading.  so, i just spent about 30 minutes with the Apple Tech support for iPODS/Touch, and after they checked at length with several experts at their end, they were able to ASSURE ME that the OUTWARD-FACING camera is indeed a 5MP sensor! YEAH!  what i think is happening is that someone in charge of mktg communications (incl spec sheets) is confusing the two cameras on the Touch, and also confusing video vs photo/still resolutions.  eg, the reference to ""VGA quality"" is terminology usually applied to video quality. in this case, i believe it is meant to describe only the video quality of the forward-facing camera. This camera is used by Facetime, which is bandwidth-limited to operate only over wi-fi at this time - not a 3G connection. I believe Facetime can only process VGA quality (correct me if that is wrong).  on the other hand, the outward-facing camera claims ""720p-HD video."" and what i struggled with here is how a sensor that is capable of HD video can only capture a 1MP photo, as some have suggested here. that just does not seem consistent to me.  now overlay that with the new iOS version announced yesterday which builds in the HDR feature - an image capture and algorithm technique intended to boost image quality. this feature suggests a dedication to image quality, which would be at odds with supplying only a 1MP sensor for the outward-facing camera! a cheap sensor would produce horrible results, and undermine Apple's messaging around the Touch's first-rate image quality (eg, HD video, retina display, etc).  therefore, I am convinced that the Apple techs are correct in assuring me that this is a 5MP sensor (outward-facing camera).  Lastly, i encouraged the techs to ask their contacts in the mktg communications dept to rewrite the specs sheet on video/photo resolutions, clearly distinguishing between the outward-facing and inward-facing cameras.  hope this helps everyone! ---------------------------------------",0,1,0,0,0,,,,990,23,1,J. Austin,"Hello Quan, Thanks for contacting Apple. I notice in your website post follow-up that you contacted them again and found out that it is NOT a 5MP camera, but is a 0.7 MP camera as the specs say.  I had a similar situation with Apple. The first time I contacted them they assured me it was the same 5mp sensor, as Steve Jobs said, ""An iPhone w/o a phone and contract"".  The second person I talked to said the specs on the web are correct, it is a .7 MP camera and both the processor and lens are different than the one on the iPhone. And there is no flash so the user will need really good light to use it.  The original plan was to make it the same shape (rectangular) as the iPhone w/ a similar camera sensor. The back was to be made of scratch resistant aluminum like the MB Pro body. Somewhere along the way someone decided to go w/ the same, though slimmer and lighter, body as the 3rd generation and put a minimal camera in it.  My thoughts: Anyone who has used a digital camera in dark settings knows how poor (grainy, noisy) the images turn out. The HD video on the apple web site was shot in bright sunlight and the panning is so smooth and slow I have to think it was mounted on a tripod. I greatly suspect when people starting taking stills and video with this, they will be greatly disappointed.  Ironically, I would have better feelings towards apple if they had not put a camera in there at all versus putting a low quality camera in it and trying to spin the iPod as being the same as the iPhone w/o a phone. The other features make it (almost) worth the upgrade, but the way they are doing this has really turned me off to them.   The sales rep said most of the calls they are getting are about this very issue. Lots of people changing their mind and not placing orders or canceling their existing orders.

I'll post my review when I have it in hand but really it is just an upgrade and much of the value is in the apps so I think it is reasonable to comment on the new features without having one yet. You did a good job.  Having a rear facing camera is good but as I choose NOT to buy an iPhone, due to the forced data plan, I also carry a phone with a decent camera so the Touch camera isn't a big deal to me. I've had video capability for a few years but don't use it much so that isn't a big focus for me either.  What I'm looking forward to is the built in microphone. I have a couple of external microphones but having one built in will simplify my needs. I'm glad the 4G has one. With that I can use Skype, and Dragon to have Speech to Text entry to also.  Another thing I'm looking forward to is the faster processor and longer battery life.  Thickness isn't that big a deal. I have a snap on case that makes my 3g thicker. If Apple wanted to make it smaller in my pocket I wish they would have a different finish on the back that didn't take on fingerprints and wasn't smooth. If they changed the back I wouldn't have to buy a case and it would be thinner!  The forward facing camera is interesting if Skype would be able to use it so I can call people that have video capability on their PC or Mac. I don't know many people I'd want to video chat that have an Apple handheld and are on WiFi.  Perhaps I'll like the retina display but frankly the 3G display is so good I'm not seeking a better display.  Sept 6 added comment. I've decided not to purchase at this time.

This is a disgrace, because the primary function of a player is to play music. I have done listening tests comparing a gen 4 (photo) iPod to a gen 2 iPod touch. I did not use headphones, but a high-end stereo system.  The results have been shocking: the old iPod sounds incredibly better than the new one.  For the comparison I used classical recordings with low or no compression. I have to agree that the new iPod sound is inferior to the sound of some older models.  The ""photo"" iPod spends most of its time in the glove compartment of my BMW, where is used as a massive-capacity CD changer. The touch is mostly used as a PDA (including as a Kindle ebook reader,) so the sound quality issue is not crucial.  I was planning to get an iPod classic as a music listening device. The reason for choosing a classic is the availability of ALE. ALE (or Apple Lossless Encoding) allows to compress CDs without any loss of information. With ALE a 120 GB classic can store 400 CDs without any information loss: the digital stream is identical to the content of the CDs down to the last bit.  A perfect digital bitstream, however, will not help if the analog section of the classic is as bad as the analog section of the gen 2 touch. I want to thank to author of this post for his attention to sound-quality issues. They are of primary importance for me, too.  PS It is, of course, possible to use docks that extract the digital bitstream from an iPod and then route the digital signal to a high-quality Digital to Analog Converter (DAC.) This solution is very expensive and I don't see any advantage in using it rather than sending the digital output from, say, a Mac Mini directly to the DAC. With an external 1 GB HD a Mac Mini can store thousands of ALE-compressed CDs. The point of the iPod classic should be to get high quality music in a compact format: solutions using large docks are not acceptable.",1,0,0,0,0,,,,1095,29,1,L.

You may have chosen ALE or AIFF from a purist perspective which is admirable, but you have a file format that is not portable friendly.  And just because iTunes may not ""downconvert"" your music for you doesn't mean other software can't.

I wanted to point out to you that your statement about the iPod will 'never be a replacement for killer home fi' may no longer be accurate. For the past 8 months or so, Wadia has given us the 170i Transport which overrides the digital output for the iPod for a vastly improved digital signal.  I don't know if you know much about Wadia, but this Transport for the iPod is probably the only hi-fi device of theirs that I could afford.  So the iPod classic is making its way in there.  Also for other comments here about iRivers & other products not making it to the starting line, well I've owned an iRiver for the past 6 years, but one thing I haven't seen with iRivers or the others are these great support accessories. Besides the Wadia, several aftermarket car stereos offer a good deal of iPod support, including tagging tracks to the iPod when listening to the radio for example, or running the iPod's output into the same DAC used by the car receiver's cd player.  My poor iRiver currently runs through the aux jack on a factory stereo & it just can't get the same kind of loudness that I could get from the iPod classic.  A thumb drive of music hooked to an aftermarket car receiver's usb jack can get a louder sound than my iRiver.  The iRiver, at least my generation needs to have its drive mounted & closed properly when hooked into USB on the PC, so I wouldn't trust to hook it into a car stereo receiver.  The bottom line is that it seems the iPod has really taken off & I'm ready to make the switch.

I'm ""relatively"" new to iPods.  (My first iPod was the 30 gig video iPod ~2005/2006?  Several nanos (I'm a runner!), a 120 ""classic"" from 2007 (or 2008...it was after the 160 was pulled from the market) & a 3G iPhone.  I'm lusting after this baby b/c I also have a large music library (including some old time radio shows as well as a handful of home brew family videos.)  As you say, it's just so nice to have everything in your library with you.  Certainly a luxury...but oh, so nice.  (I'm 53, so I remember the ""luxury"" of 8 track tapes, then cassette tapes, then CDs.  And now to think a roomful of 8 tracks fit into the palm of my hand...AMAZING!!!)    I appreciate that you mention that hard drive based iPods are not the best for runners.  I know *some* people run with them with no problems.  But seriously, jostling a hard drive anything *that much* (IE several runs over a period of time) is just not a good idea.    Thanks agin!",1,0,0,0,0,,,,1165,34,1,H. Tapia,"RobS, I hate iTunes but only keep it installed on my PC for firmware updates and for properly setting up the chapter marks in my home-made mp3 books. (These ""books"" are actually recorded lectures.)  I use ""Media Monkey"" to maintain my music and sync with the iPod.  I have a rather involved process of ripping CDs which consists of using EAC in secure mode to create a flawless digital duplicate of the CD (takes nearly 4-5 min per CD...longer for CDs in bad condition) which are stored in a lossless format (WavPack, but you could easily use FLAC and probably be better off for it).  I then use these lossless ""masters"" to compress down to 192kbs VBR MP3s which I then load up via Media Monkey to the iPod.  The beauty of digital masters is that you can redo your entire MP3s as one big overnight batch process if you get an itch to try out a different compression setting or other tweak.  As for your last point, your vinyl 1977 recording did in fact sound as good as you remembered!  This isn't nearly as much the digital equipments fault as it is the mastering engineer's fault.  Look up ""loudness war"" to read about the trend over the years to make songs louder by compressing the dynamic range. (Wikipedia has a very nice graphic to illustrate the trend.) Modern recordings have almost no depth which is why you can't tell the difference between a CD and a 128kbs MP3.  It's not the equipment's fault...the recordings are fatally flawed.  Very sad.",0,0,1,0,0,,,,1166,34,0,RobS,"When I get the itch, I'll keep what you said about ripping in mind (if I can figure it out, LOL!). I need a new computer first. This one is a 933MHz PIII and quite slow for ripping en mass.  I understand a lot of the earlier CD catalogs were mastered rather poorly (some of my early CDs sound like crap), but  how about of the new ""remastered"" versions? When I buy new CDs, I try and make sure they are the most recent mastering, and if possible, I buy the SACD version (I've never A/Bd them to see if they are THAT much better).  I usually listen to my iPod through $25 earbuds, and gave my old Sony MDR-V2 headphones a listen to the old ELO Out of the Blue album, which was engineered pretty good back in ""77. It did sound better (duh), though not AS good as I remember. Maybe I need to upgrade to the MDR-V6s.",1,0,0,1,0,,,,1167,34,0.6666667,H. Tapia,"RobS,  I think the problem with earlier CDs was that they were too quiet at times even tho they were applying the same technique they used for vinyl recording.  From what I gather, each remastering produces a louder product with lower dynamics.  Given that, I avoid re-released, remastered CDs (unless it includes some new must-have material) and go after earlier releases and just fix the volume issue when i compress down to MP3.  Go to the Wikipedia entry for ""loudness war"" and then click the link for reference #33 at the bottom.  That will take you to a great article written by a recording engineer about Rush's ""Vapor Trails"" album and how it got butchered in order to make it louder.  It's well written so anyone can understand what is going on.  For additional help for making quality MP3s as well as answering your other questions about SACD, go look up 'hydrogenaudio' and visit their forum and wiki pages for some great guides and resources.  It's where I learned a lot of this.",0,0,1,0,0,,,,1168,34,0.5,M. Clark,"As for SACDs, they should be reserved for listening on your SACD player on home stereo equipment.

Tapia, Woah, I read the Wiki article, as well as the You Tube link (and subsequent Y.T. videos). It's sad to see the industry dumbing down the quality of everything. I assumed (wrongly) that use of modern equipment that didn't exist when a CD was first mastered would translate into a group re-releasing a ""remastered"" version that would sound better. Examples sound squished and flat, a little like Stereo vs Mono.

So you do a complete syncing every time you plug your iPod in?  Are you nuts?  You know you can set it to ""manual"" and you can easily drag and drop the songs you want to hear, one at a time or all at the same time.    Also, you have 200GB of music, you mean to tell me you listen to every last track?    Also, are you converting all the cds to AAC or MP3?  Your last paragraph didn't make much sense.  What do you mean the ""other storage will continue to grow""  how is that possible if the only way to get files onto the ipod is by syncing it with your itunes?  I am assuming that ""other storage"" means your computer?  But, that storage will be used up the more music you put onto your computer.

Clark,"This reply wasn't directed at me, but I think I can answer to it...  I do an automatic sync as well. The only time it takes more than a minute or so is if I've either added a LOT of music since the last sync, or if it's been a significant amount of time since my last sync and I've added, deleted, and otherwise made file changes in the meantime. If it's taking 8-10 minutes, I imagine he's going weeks or months between syncs.  As for listening to every last track....I also have my 160GB filled with pretty much my entire collection, and no, I don't listen to every last track, but I like knowing that I can. I like the fact that if I suddenly think of a song or album that I haven't heard in a while, that I can get to it on the fly.  I don't know about the guy you're responding to, but I personally convert to MP3 for it's versatility.
