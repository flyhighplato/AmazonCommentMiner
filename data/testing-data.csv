302,2,0,"Mary L. Ringer","Jeffrey's original review convinced me to ask for a Kindle for Christmas, and I am so glad I did. And I also got the lighted cover which makes it possible for me to pick up the Kindle in the middle of the night when I've been awakened, read a few pages, and go back to sleep fairly easily. My only complaint is that I am going through books way too fast!",0,0,,,,,,,,,

305,2,0,"Chelle92","You need to be in the Critics business... this is one of the best reviews I've ever read! And I was a market researcher for awhile and read thousands of reviews on products.  Now, to my question...  I don't have an iPad. I do have an iPhone. I do have a MacBook Pro.  I decided during the summer to go back to college again and was thinking about getting either the Kindle or the Nook.  Do you have knowledge of the Nook and could give me some advice on which would be better suited for reading textbooks and such?  (Or even IF textbooks are downloadable?) I know I that there are many textbook companies that are making some available as downloads, but I've not done so as yet. Didn't want to have to lug around my laptop, hence this digital reader gadget caught my attention.",1,0,,,,,,,,,
306,2,0,"Jeffrey Stanley","Chelle92,  I don't have any experience with using the kindle as a textbook reader. There are plenty of comments and other reviews stating that it is a bad choice for text books, mainly because there are no real page number reference in Kindle books. Also keep in mind that the Kindle doesn't do a great job of displaying graphics, charts, or illustrations. It displays text beautifully, but that is about all. I would consult college bookstores and college students to find out if textbooks are widely available in Kindle format, but I doubt it.   I recently acquired the newest iphone with ""retina"" display. The improved resolution of the newest iphone and ipod touch really improves the reading experience on these devices. They are great for reading text, but they still have the huge limitation of battery life issues if the display is on for a long time. The ipad has a really strong battery, but the display resolution is poor enough that I would not want to read on it for an extended period of time. I wouldn't recommend any Apple tablet device as a textbook reader.  The new Macbook Air is around $1k if you can live within a 64gb hard drive, which would not be too difficult if you don't mind keeping media files (music and video) on an external hard drive. It is nearly as portable as the ipad, but has a higher res screen, can run most software, and is much much more powerful than ipad.   Good luck on your research and return to campus.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
307,2,0,"Hzleyes","I would tell you that I purchased my Kindle right when the new BN Reader came out. I  read the reviews and seen the ads, and thought I had made a mistake in purchasing the Kindle with the lighted cover to boot. I even put in a return; however, I went to BN to see the reader first hand. What struck me immediately was how much heavier it was, despite it's small size. I loved the color screen etc, but after 15mins, the glare started to bother my eyes. The Kindle's e-ink is great. I have the 3G and am currently in Japan. It is as fast as if I was in the US. Charges great and holds it too. I find the lighted cover great, especially for reading in the bed.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

310,2,0,"PT Ted","A very good review, and I enjoyed reading all the follow up comments.  I just got a K3 Wi Fi only, and am ""satisfied.""  It is a great reader, good selection of books, most at very modest prices for what I want.  I like having the text to speech option, too, as well as being able to change the text size, font, and so on.  For me it is still not quite as good as reading from paper in some lighting situations.  The screen really is a medium grey (not a dark grey), and the contrast not entirely to my satisfaction.  It is acceptable, but not as good as I had hoped.  I would like to see better use of the ""shortcuts"" feature.  Although it is nice to have a shortcut to add or delete a bookmark, having a keyboard shortcut to go directly to the ""bookmarks"" page would be helpful, as would having a shortcut to go back and forward between bookmarks, right from the page I am reading.  Right now it is a bit ""awkard"" compared to having bookmarks in a real book.  I can see where they are right away!  That said, I am still delighted with this product.  I don't have a nook, ipad, or smartphone, so I needed a product like this and am glad I have it.  Another MINOR IRRITATION is the inability to customize or choose which ""wallpaper"" will pop up when the Kindle is put on ""standby.""  A variety of images, only a few of which even moderately appeal to me, pop up in a random fashion, as if to say, ""Go the the Kindle store and buy some classic authors' works!""  I would, at mininum, like to chose which one pops up, or even better, be able to import an image I like.  In my ""wish"" list, the larger DX would fall in price.  I would pay $100 more for it, but not another $240!",1,0,,,,,,,,,
311,2,0,"J. Embury","This review is right on regarding the Kindle replacing books. It is easy to read and text is fantastic. If you want color or pictures, get an Ipad. The great thing over books is that when you are in Tokyo, Jakarta or KL and it is 11:00 pm and you are wide awake with jet lag and just finished that novel you bought in LA. You can get the sequel to the book delivered in about 1 minute after ordering at 1/3 to 1/4 the cost at the airport book store. In this situation the Kindle is worth 5 times what you paid just in convenience alone. Happy reading.",1,0,,,,,,,,,

I am a devoted customer to B&N and have been a member for years.  I have a nook and like it.  I love Amazon too for shopping and couldn't resist getting a Kindle.  I do travel and I do need a lot of technical books.  Those techie books are big and heavy and you can't travel with them.  When they are out of date used book stores turn their nose up at them.  I'm looking forward to moving some of my pdf books to the kindle and purchasing future IT books for the Kindle.  Anyways thanks for the review.  Can hardly wait to get mine, not till late September :(",1,0,,,,,,,,,
320,3,1,"B. Harman","I would have to say I agree I far prefer the Kindle for reading to the iPad. Reading outside on the iPad is virtually impossible. If you can deal with the glare and washed out resolution be prepared to only read for an hour at which time you are informed the iPad is too hot to play any longer. The Kindle on the other hand has none of these issues; it is like a wonderful paperback that won't let the wind ruffle it's pages.",1,0,,,,,,,,,
321,3,1,"Arts&HistoryFan","Retired English Teacher and Vincent,   I'll add one thing.  My Comcast cable AND at other times (too often), my electricity goes out for hours at a time.      During those times I've used my Kindle (which is always charged up pretty high) and a clip-on light to read and read.    I once used it during a Comcast shutdown, to go online and buy something I needed and checked email to get info for the purchase.  Normally, one would use that time to finally get a good rest and reconnect with the real world though.    But these may well be ultra rare for you.      For others, this kind of 3G wireless normally costs $30-$60 per month to get, and the iPad costs an additional $130 to just get the 3g capability at all, before the cost of using it.    Except for people who spend most of their time home and have good Internet connectivity most of the time and don't have electrical outages (I don't know why they're so prevalent where I am), it's $50 saved that could be regretted later.    It provides more opportunity in case.   BUT those who have smartphone connectivity already won't find it that useful except to sync the reading of a book with the reading of same book on the other devices.      And I agree it's a good decision for Retired English Teacher to go for just the WiFi (as long as it doesn't keep dropping the connection as my Comcast has been doing to my neighbors and me).   - Andrys http://kindleworld.blogspot.com",0,0,,,,,,,,,
322,3,1,"M. Allen","Can you better explain this?  I'm not sure I understand what you are saying.    ""BUT those who have smartphone connectivity already won't find it that useful except to sync the reading of a book with the reading of the same book on the other devices.""

I don't really understand what you are saying about 'to sync the reading of a book with the reading of the same book on the other devices''  Can you please elaborate on that...thank you so much in advance....",0,0,,,,,,,,,
323,3,1,"Arts&HistoryFan","M.,   What I meant was that the free 3G Wireless Web Browser won't be that useful for those who already pay  a monthly fee for 3G Wireless Web on their smartphone   -- but they might find use for the Kindle's 3G in that they'd be able, wherever they are (no WiFi hotspot needed), to open up their smartphone and continue reading the same book on their smartphone as they had stopped reading on another Kindle device.  The sync'g means that the smartphone would have a way to connect to Amazon servers to get the last-page number you were on when reading on another device.    They key is that when you finish reading on one device you need to turn on wireless and do a Sync & Check ot make sure the servers have the info on your last-page read (say, on your actual Kindle).    Then when you open your smartphone it'll get that last page and open your book from there.    Sorry I wasn't clearer.    - Andrys http://kindleworld.blogspot.com",0,0,,,,,,,,,
324,3,0,"M. Allen","Thank you so much for clarifying.  I have a 3G smartphone and am currently researching the Kindle to decide which one I need to purchase.  So if I already have a 3G phone, do you see the need to purchase the Kindle with 3G?  Does the Kindle have to have 3G to sync to the smartphone?  I don't plan to do any traveling with the Kindle.  I really appreciate the time you took to answer my previous question.  I am new to the Kindle world and it looks so exciting!  I just don't want to pay for the 3G if I really won't need it and if the Kindle with wi-fi only will do.    Again thanks in advance for the time you take to respond.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

I would have not have signed off quite the same way.     But, yes, 3G does eliminate the need for a router UNLESS your home has no AT&T coverage.   If your smartphone is on AT&T and you can use it at home then you're fine.  The coverage map links are found in the middle of the info at the Amazon product pages.  Most urban areas do have it.  Hope that helps!  Let us know if you have trouble finding the coverage map.   - Andrys",0,0,,,,,,,,,

331,4,0.25,"M. M. Jackson","Respectfully, I completely disagree on one point...  Flying down the highway with my wife driving at 80mph without a smartphone (and concomitant mandatory data plan), it is very nice to use that ""useless, out of place experiment"" that is the web browser to plot a new route using Google Maps. Or heck, even just to check your email. Viva la Experimental Browser, and in case anyone is wondering, if you ever find yourself in a pinch here or there (dead smartphone, GPS on the fritz, who knows what else) it is SO nice to have 3g as an ""insurance policy""...that is assuming Amazon continues to extend us the free 3g web browsing, which I do hope will continue indefinitely. It was a huge selling point.   A FINE POINT ON EMAIL - FOR GMAIL USERS:  By the way, for gmail, if you want the ""full"" (but tiny) experience, you use http://mail.google.com/mail/  If you want the ""portable optimized"" (but still relatively full featured, missing only things like Gmail's Priority Inbox) you use http://mail.google.com/mail/mu and then bookmark whichever you like better.  I was having trouble loading the page for some reason when ""just"" using http://www.gmail.com . Those two alternate addresses above worked a treat.  Cheers!",0,0,,,,,,,,,
332,4,1,"Lonestar fan","So are you saying with the 3G version you can actually look things up like gmail and google maps??  I was just debating whether the 3G was that necessary- I do have wifi at home but would be using my Kindle to carry with me so I would never be caught without reading material.  Is it totally worth the extra 50 bucks for the 3G?  Thanks!",0,0,,,,,,,,,
333,4,1,"M. M. Jackson","My answer is an unqualified YES. It's phenomenal. I dithered for a while on whether I should spend the extra $50, but as an ""insurance policy"" of sorts, it simply cannot be beat. Even if it only lasts another year (recall it's been free for three years running), it  was still only $4.17 a month for the privelege and ""insurance policy""...beats the pants off of a $20+ data plan *on top of* an already pricey $50-70 smartphone plan.   (I say this with the assumption the user is merely an occasional - not chronic - user of the internet while mobile...the experience is too clunky for minute-by-minute use...it's best for a once-or-twice-a-day email check or some in-depth web article reading sessions...)  Is it clunky? Yes. A touch slow? Yes. Often printed tiny? Yes.   But, alas, it is a real-deal, unrestricted connection, it works nationwide without having to STOP or find a hotspot, and those tiny characters are quite zoomable.   Yes, it is utterly unrestricted. You can look up dirty jokes or jump on StumbleUpon and wile away your life if you so desire...you will just see it all in black and white. It is surprisingly crisp and this internet access - for the time being anyways - is not going away (in Amazon's own words).   Surfing using a toggle button configuration is by no means FUN, but by golly it works. Like I said, clunky is the word here. With a service like gmail, you use the portable-optimized mail.google.com/mail/mu interface and you will be loving life on this thing. Use the standard gmail.com or mail.google.com/mail and it's a bit of a challenge, but you win back Gmail's brilliant Priority Inbox, etc. It's up to you.   One thing I WOULD recommend, for the sake of preservation of the free 3g itself, is to take as much burden off of the 3g network as possible: in other words, if you are home and have a wi-fi network, enter the darn password and make sure it shows wi-fi as the network. In this way, we will reduce the burden (and therefore either the potential throttling of bandwith or cancellation of the ""experimental"" but beautifully free internet access).   That is what I did...my Kindle was a little fickle getting on to my network (it will say ""failed"" if the signal is not strong enough. Two rooms and three walls away, it was not strong enough. I move one wall closer and it works a treat in my house.)  But yeah, imagine your home internet goes down a while...or imagine flying down some unfamiliar out-of-state highway and, without having to stop, checking your email...gratis. In so many ways, it's a beautiful thing.  - Matt  p.s. the idea that you could pass this info on to, let us say, an elderly relative or mature friend who doesn't have internet in order to ""get them online"" let us say is technically correct - it would technically acheive the desired result in a cost-free fashion (well, at the cost of the $50 ""upgrade"" to the 3g+wifi model). However, I want to be crystal clear: this is not a browsing interface for newbies or tyros to the internet. Not at all. It is basically a pain in the rear end for anyone who is not very well versed with internet use and with a relatively low aptitide for ""newfangled gadgets."" Just so we are clear, newfangled gadget IQ is very much required here. Don't mean to patronize, but I am just used to dealing with people who are slightly clueless with computers, technology and especially gadgets.   Cheers!",0,0,,,,,,,,,
334,4,0,"Lonestar fan","Thank you so much for the info-- it sounds like this might be a bit easier to 'surf' on then my cell phone, which has a web browser but is not a smart phone and will not even do G-mail, so trying to do anything on it is really not worth the effort.

The new Kindle replaces the old five-way navigation joystick with a center button surrounded by a thin 4-way directional control.  After messing around with both of these approaches, I do not have a strong personal preference one way or another - they both work fine for me.  If you have big hands then I can definitely see having a bit of trouble getting used to the new joystick.  The directional control really is very thin, and if you're going to have trouble with any button on the Kindle... that's going to be the one.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

347,5,1,"Karen Grattan","Hi, thanks for the video. I don't own a kindle, but have been lurking around watching the developments over the last few years. I was wondering if you can say anything about the PDF document management, and the ability to highlight and make notes on your PDFs. This is a biggie for me, and a feature that has me confused between the DX, Kindle 3 and whether or not you have the files converted... oh, and can you get PDF document read to you if they are in native versus converted? I am working on my dissertation and love the idea of having my documents with me at all times... but I would want to take notes, and it would be great to be read to while driving. Can't wait until this paper is done, so I can read some books for pleasure!! Thanks for your advice on this one. ;-)",1,0,,,,,,,,,
348,5,1,"Steven Gargolinski","Hi Karen - Honestly I don't read a TON of PDFs on my Kindle, but I do every once in a while.  PDF management is very easy - I just plug my Kindle into my PC and copy the files over, piece of cake.  Sometimes I use the email-based conversion method if I find something at work and don't have my Kindle handy.  I do not have a lot of experience with highlights/notes unfortunately, maybe someone else will be able to comment.  Unfortunately you cannot have PDFs read to you unless you convert them over to the Kindle format.  Overall the main problem I've had with academic PDFs on the Kindle 3 (or 2) is that they are obviously not designed to be read on a 6"" screen.  It's often necessary to use landscape mode and zoom around to see what you need.  If this is your primary use then you may want to check out the DX.  If you're like me and only read PDFs every once in a while, then the Kindle 3 definitely gets the job done.  I've also been impressed with how good images look.

355,5,1,"Ron Cronovich","To P.J. Holt:  You asked about downloading research articles and textbook availability.    If your research articles are in PDF format, then you CAN put them on the kindle.  You plug your kindle into your computer using the included USB cable, then your kindle shows up on your computer as a ""drive,"" like a thumb drive would.  Then you drag PDF files from your computer to this kindle ""drive,"" and dismount the kindle drive.  Then, these PDF files will be on your kindle and they will show up on your Kindle's home screen.    But there are some possible problems.  First, PDFs containing certain kinds of graphics or images will not display properly on the kindle, and some will not open at all.  (I have tried this with many PDF files and have experienced these problems.)  Second, the kindle's 6"" screen is a serious limitation.  Most PDF files I've worked with contain pages that are intended to be about the same size as a printed 8.5 x 11"" page.  Open a file like this on the kindle, and the entire page will be shrunk so that it'll fit on the kindle's small screen.  It will be hard to read.  You can change your kindle to landscape orientation, which helps a little.  You can also zoom in to any part of the page, which then becomes easily readable, but you then have to pan around to read the entire page.  This is very inconvenient in my experience.    The bottom line is if you want to read research articles in PDF format, you should consider getting a Kindle DX, which has a much larger screen.  I used to have one and it worked much better for PDF documents, much less panning and zooming required.  Yet, even with the larger screen, I still wasn't completely happy reading PDF research articles on the Kindle DX, and usually went back to my computer for that.     Regarding textbook availability:  None of us have in our heads a complete list of which textbooks are available for kindle.  But if you have a particular textbook in mind, search for it on Amazon, and the Amazon product page will tell you whether it's available for kindle.    There's a bigger issue with textbooks on the kindle.  Most textbooks have pages much larger than the kindle's small screen, and many textbooks contain large graphs or images.  Kindle's 6"" screen will struggle with this.  If you want to use Kindle for textbooks, and if the textbooks you need are indeed available for the kindle, then you should strongly consider the Kindle DX - its much larger screen will make for a much better experience reading a textbook.   But one last caveat:  I read an article in the New York Times a couple months ago about a college campus that experimented with kindles.  A large group of students was given Kindle DXs loaded with their textbooks.  At the end of the semester, most students said they strongly preferred regular textbooks to Kindle textbooks.  They said that kindles were great for leisure reading, which is generally highly linear - you just read one page, then the next, then the next, until you finish the book.  With textbooks, most students said they read in non-linear way, jumping around to the glossary or index, jumping back to different parts of the chapter, etc.  They found kindle DX inconvenient for this type of non-linear reading.  Also, they complained that graphics and images often didn't display properly on their kindles.  (The reason I remember all this is (a) I'm a college professor and (b) I'm very interested in kindles and other e-readers and how they might be used in college.)    So I guess I would say that, unfortunately, e-reader technology is probably not yet advanced enough to make for a positive experience for the kinds of things you want to do with it.  For now, you might be better off with a laptop or netbook with high-res display, which would be better for reading research articles and textbooks than would a Kindle or similar e-reader.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

Personally I went with the 3G version since I end up buying a lot of books when I'm out and about away from wireless networks, but if you want to save the money and will be downloading books mostly at home (or somewhere else where you have access to Wifi) then you should be good with the wifi version.  There's no backlight in the new Kindle, but there is a really solid leather cover/case available with a built-in light.

385,5,1,"C. Wilson","Hey thanks so much for the COMPARATIVE video btw the 2nd and 3rd generation kindles. I've had my 2nd generation since it hit the market and was wondering if it was worth it to upgrade to the 3rd generation. Although I can appreciate the better clarity and faster page turning, it isn't enough to prompt me to purchase a 3rd generation. If a 4th generation is born, maybe I'll upgrade then if the features are better. Of course, if my 2nd gen were to be damaged, I'd be purchasing whatever the latest generation available is that very same day - can't go without my kindle! I read every day, esp. at night.  Thanks too for the review on the amazon kindle covers. My gen. 2 cover just broke and I was considering buying a 3rd gen cover (even though the light wouldn't work with the 2nd gen) in case I DID decide to upgrade to a 3rd gen. (so I wouldn't have to buy another cover), but your review clearly showed the size difference btw the different generations and kept me from making that error.  I would say that the only thing I envy about the difference btw the 2 generations is the built in book light in the amazon cover for the 3rd generation. Currently I use the ""light wedge"" book light with my 2nd generation. Which I LOVE. I like to lay down on my side and read and the amazon book cover makes a nice ""sideways stand"" which the light wedge leans against and it delivers light evenly across the kindle with absolutely no glare. Great ilttle set-up if you like to read laying down! It would be nice to have a book light built in to the book cover though, for any time I don't have the light wedge with me.",1,0,,,,,,,,,

They may look complicated, but if your follow each step, one after the other, they will work.  After you set up the email, try sending a photo. They will show up on your Kindle in black and white, of course, because the K3 doesn't show color, but they have a very nice quality, IMO.

As far as transferring your books to your new K3 is concerned, just follow the instructions I copied to the above post, from 10.1 of the Manual. I think the word ""transfer"" is somewhat ambiguous, because to me it means taking something from one place to another. In fact, after transferring, your books will be on your new K3, but will also remain on your old K2. In this case I think ""transferring"" means ""sending copies.""",0,0,,,,,,,,,

If not, don't bother reading further.  But, if you are . . .  On the 5th model, I finally reached a tech support person who didn't ask about the Kindle but about the case I was using. I thought that was pretty strange. But, it turns out that some of them are defective, and since they have the new units that have the lights that run off the battery of the Kindle, those metal connectors actually do more than just connect the Kindle to the cover (whether or not you have the lighted model). Since they are used to power the light on that type of case with the built in light, those leads are connected to the electronic operation of the K3 models. My problem went completely away when I stopped using that same case I had used on all 5 units that had the problems freezing and restarting. (If that is your problem, note that they will send you a new case/cover.) I was pretty amazed that this solved the problem. Further, I did not have the type of case with the light. Nevertheless, since those connector points potentially involve current, if you use standard Kindle case, the occasional defective case is either shorting or throwing some variable load across those leads and causing the freezing and restarting. I have not had a single problem (was happening every 10 minutes before) since I quit using that one case. Incredible.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

427,7,0.9166667,"nutjob","People should consider some basic notions in statistics and human behaviour before they jump to conclusions. All devices sold have a failure rate, you can't avoid this. No mass produced device is perfect in every instance.   Also a person is more likely to post a review (and a very negative one) if they received a faulty device. So if 5% of reviews are one star (as they are here) it doesn't mean that 5% are faulty (generalising and assuming all one star reviews were due to a faulty product). There could be a 10:1 ratio between those who had no problems and those who got a fault device. A 0.5% to 1% failure rate is more realistic. We can safely assume about 75% of people who got a faulty one wrote a negative review. Maybe less than 10% of people who had no problems wrote a review. I've purchase maybe 100 items from Amazon and I've written one review. If you're angry and disappointed you're motivated to try to stick it to Amazon, the source of your anger and disappointment.  Being outraged, no matter how disappointing the experience is, is misplaced. You just send in the device and get a new one. If you get several ""bad"" devices in a row, statistically the chances are that the device is not the problem, and some other factor is (such as the case, as noted in some reviews). If the device was really that bad there would be an overwhelming number of bad reviews here.  I'm not defending the Kindle here, just stating the facts. Not buying a product based on one bad review is not sensible. You could be missing out on a great product due to the personality or circumstances of a particular individual. Why should that deny you a possible very good experience? You're trusting the experience and opinion of a single person you've never met and know nothing about.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

For me, though, the ""point of buying a DSLR"" is to be able to take advantage of ALL the capabilities it offers, not just one. I understand the basics of setting ISO and the impact it has on image quality. There are times, though, when I'd like to set the ISO on auto for when I'm in a rapidly changing environment and don't have time to switch it between shots.  Walking the streets of India in December, in one second I'd want to snap a wide-angle, sunny street scene with a rickshaw going by, and the very next, I'd want a candid close-up of a woman selling vegetables under an awning. I was with a group, which was constantly on the move, and there wasn't time in the fast-changing environment to stop and change ISO and still get the shot. That was before I had my d3100, but if I hadn't used auto ISO in those situations, I'd NEVER have gotten most of the shots. You may use your camera differently, but please don't judge the valid desire of others to use auto ISO on occasion (or all the time if that's their preference).

1628,57,0,"James Fryer","Nigeria N. Hammad,  I suggest starting with Aperture Priority. Especially with the 35mm f1.8 lens set at 1.8. That will really show off the shallow depth of field that lens is capable of. If you look really closely at the results, you may notice that the lens gets sharper as you stop it down (especially at around f5.6 or f8). Once you have gotten a handle on how the depth of field and sharpness are changed by the aperture, move on to shutter priority to start seeing the effects of slow vs. fast shutter speeds, especially on moving objects.

1631,58,0.6666667,"kgvenky","I do not rule out the fact that Nikon D3100 can produce good images in PASM modes. But the Auto ISO logic is so bad that in AUTO mode it can not even produce a single image in Good quality. It totally neglects the Built-in or optional flash capability, if the subject is not in good lighting condition, it sets high ISO value, regardless of whether you use flash or not. Please check yourself with AUTO mode and AUTO-NO FLASH mode. Auto ISO value will be the same. Only the image will be brighter with flash, but it will have same grains like AUTO-NO FLASH because of high ISO value. Earlier models like D60 or D40 was working fine. These models used to set ISO at 200 with using with FLASH (say a person face at 5 feet distance), which produced good quality image.  Why this change in D3100, I believe the same issue with D7000 also.  If used with P mode with Max ISO set to 200, D3100 is producing good result in the same situation.  My intention is to warn people about AUTO and AUTO ISO behavior in D3100. Most of the entry level DSLR buyers are NOT well versed with PASM modes, they tend to use AUTO mode. They believe AUTO mode can produce better image than their own setting in PASM mode (Like, I thought, before D3100).",0,0,,,,,,,,,

1634,58,1,"kgvenky","There was discussions on Auto ISO issues in D3100 in this forum sometime back. We discussed a lot. The conclusion was not to use FULL AUTO & Auto ISO as suggested by many members. Thank you members for your help and support.  Please find below reply from Nikon support team  Dear Sir,  thank you for contacting us and for your feedback. The D3100 is an entry level DSLR and the auto mode emphasises on optimum exposure levels in difficult lighting situations. The D3100 also gives much better results at high ISO levels as compared to earlier Nikon DSLRs. This is the reason why in auto mode with flash, to obtain a balanced background exposure, the camera, at certain situations, (especially with a dark background) selects high ISOs. If you want to use lower ISO levels, you can choose modes which allow you to change ISO levels, or to restrict auto ISO range to a particular value. For further support, you can contact our technical support numbers as provided at http://www.nikon.co.in/pagearticle.php?pageid=86-69152fddfb .  Regards,  Nikon India Technical Support  My message to Nikon was as...  THE PROBLEM WITH NIKON D3100 (I use with NIKON SB-600 External Flash Unit) In AUTO mode, Nikon D3100 selects only ""AUTO ISO SENSITIVITY""  WITH FLASH UNIT: In indoor shooting; it selects very high ISO Sensitivity (mostly ISO 3200). So the image quality is not good. In the same condition Nikon D60, selects ISO value of 200, whereas, Nikon D3100 selects ISO 3200. I mean, the Nikon D3100 is not considering the Flash Unit and is not adjusting the ISO accordingly.  WITHOUT FLASH IN CLOUDY MORNING TIME: Even in outdoor daylight shooting, Nikon D3100 uses wide variety of ISO sensitivity (100 to 1600) whereas D60 used between ISO 100 to 400, in the same lighting condition. The image quality of the D3100 is not good in AUTO mode and it is only comparable to any POINT-AND-SHOOT camera.  You can check this in dpreview site; in D3100 (in pg 14 of review) photo of the reviewer taken with built-in flash has ISO 3200, whereas for D60 (in pg 21 of review)photo of the reviewer taken with built-in flash has ISO 100. In the review they have not mentioned about this, but for curiosity, I downloaded the images and checked the EXIF information.  Even the reviewer in dpreview.com has not noticed this biggest flaw!!! It's actually a casual shot with built-in flash, the end result is grainy ISO 3200 picture.  Also, try with PASM mode, by setting SOME max ISO value. In flash mode with Auto ISO, it sets this MAX ISO. The only option we have with camera is setting ourselves an ISO value. D3100 selects high ISO values in AUTO ISO setting and the resulting in high grain pictures, which prevents you to use this entry level D-SLR for Casual photography.  I am just back from 15 days vacation, with more than 1500 pictures taken, out of which 90% taken in AUTO mode. only 3 pictures are in ISO 100. All other in ISO 400 to 1100 in daylight, and ISO - 1100 to 3200 in flash mode.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

The low light performance of the Sony is very poor in my opinion. The LCD screen barely shows the image as you are videoing and the result is equally dark and not usable. However, the Canon does very well in low light. The auto-focus takes a couple of seconds to lock if you *start* videoing at 10-14x.

1714,63,0.95555556,"C. Perez","I totally respect your point of view on these two cameras, and although I have not tried the Canon SX210, I have to disagree on some of the statements you made about the Sony HX5V.   I actually own this camera. And like in your case, my decision came down to these two models (I didn't take sample photos though; just went by the specs and some reviews).  I have to say that I have no regrets whatsoever about keeping the HX5V. I would like to note that I'm very demanding (picky) when it comes to photography. I also own a Canon 20D (DSLR) that I've had for a few years. The only reason I mention that is because with the quality of the photos taken with the 20D, it's just hard to be impressed by a P&S.   It is fair to say however, that the photos produced by the Sony HX5V are no the sharpest you will see from a P&S, but they are not that bad either. But the amount of features (very usable ones) that you get, by far overcomes that little bit of softness on the still images.  Too bad you didn't bother to check out the video mode. It's simply amazing. And you're right; the stereo mic could have been better placed, but it's not difficult to remember not to put your finger there while recording (I never put it there). The videos on my 60"" HDTV look beautiful.  You are very critic on the low light performance of the Sony HX5V. The reason that got my attention is because that precisely is one of this camera's strongest features and marketing tools. Don't take it from me; just check some expert reviews and sample photos. The sensor (back illuminated) was designed for better than average low light photography.  By the way, I'm not sure how valid the sample you used to respond to the question about low light really is, since that type of photo you took with the Canon SX210 (the after-dusk photo with a 15 sec exposure), is not precisely the type of photo that most people have in mind when they think of ""low light photography"". Most of the pictures taken by a P&S's are of moving subjects (people, animals), and not quiet landscapes.. Furthermore, since you criticize the lack of manual features on the HX5V, I will mention this: If you want to make a fair comparison, you should take that same picture using full auto in both models, and another sample using the manual controls allowed by each camera. You'd be surprised to know that the Sony model can actually go beyond the 15 sec exposure allowed by your SX210, to 30 sec, with an aperture of 3.5 and a minimum ISO of 125. And you would be even more surprised after seeing the side by side samples of the two types of photos produced by each camera (full auto and manual). That would be more like apples to apples...  I'm glad you're happy with your purchase, It's just that some of the things you say about the Sony HX5V are not true.  Enjoy your Canon SX210, it's a great camera too.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

In well-lit conditions the pictures were beautiful.    So, from my point of view, looking for point-and-shoot-ease-of-use, the sx210 s out).  I've also purchased the panasonic zs6, samsung hz30w, and sony hx5v.....I'm interested in the most consistent results, especially under low-light conditions, since most cameras do just fine in optimal lighting conditions.  So far the Sony has very pleasant results, with great video output, and better white balance than the panasonic.  Panasonic's low-light image quality is, frankly, TERRIBLE.  I recently sold my tz5, which was highly rated online, because the pictures were noisy, out-of-focus, and had very poor color balance.  I've got a friend who decided to shoot only without flash on her tz5 (sadly, recommended by me), because any other situation indoors produced so poor quality images.  I'm not surprised at all.  I took too many pictures that weren't fixable even with the most powerful post-processing. I was really awestruck by how BAD BAD BAD the images were from the Canon SX210 on auto in anything but optimal daylight lighting conditions.  Pictures were so soft they looked out of focus (not only my concern, when I returned the camera, they thought I was a newbie and told me that I had to wait for proper focus).  Nope!  Just a bad camera unless you want to use manual control. I'm the most pleased with the samsung's image quality (surprise!), but its video quality is subpar.  I recommended this camera to my in-laws, and they bought it.  It's still a STEAL from costco.  The most camera you can get for $199.  I am VERY happy with my HXV5 purchase.  The Hand-held-Twilight mode is spectacular.  In auto mode, most times, the camera will takes 2 pictures (like, one with flash, and one without).

Those photos do demonstrate better low light performance than the other cameras I am considering such as the Panasonic ts7 and the Casio FH-100.  Further while the Panny and the Casio produce video results that wow their users, the Sony is the only one of the bunch to shoot full 1080p high dep.

I am thinking of getting this camera myself and will be interested to compare.   I do agree that nothing beats the camera you actually have with you but I do also know that compacts can never fully match some of the capabilites of SLRs. Recently for instance I shot some great action photos of my family playing ping-pong in my brother's dimly-lit basement. No compact could possibly handle that situation well. I have read that this Sony has better action capability than most, so that's one reason I am considering it. But can it match what I can achieve with my Canon setup? That's pretty doubtful.   For me, it's a best-of-both worlds kind of thing. If I am just shooting casual photos and don't care too much if they turn out perfectly, a compact is fine. But when I really care about what I get, and particularly in challenging lighting and high-action situations, the SLR is simply unbeatable. Is it for everyone? Certainly not, and cost is always an issue, particularly for the casual photographer. The compacts are definitely shrinking the gap a bit, and the four-thirds cameras I find particularly interesting.

(I have an HD TV.) Is the HD selection on Netflix poor? 2. What's the actual performance difference between the Roku HD and the XD? Does the speed of my internet service matter (i.e. should I check to make sure the Roku will work with my internet?) 3. The Roku website lists an instant replay as part of the XD but not the HD--is instant replay different from pausing? Surely you can still pause the movie with the HD?  I appreciate any help you can give me! Thanks!",0,0,,,,,,,,,

The Roku HD has 720p output while the XD has 1080p.  2b. Roku suggests you have a minimum of 1.5 Mbps for SD content 3 Mbps for HD, though Netflix should adjust its quality to your internet speed so it should at least play, even if it's at lower quality. You can test your speed at www.speakeasy.net/speedtest. 3. I'd be VERY surprised if the HD couldn't pause the stream.

On the other hand, hunters tend to know what they're looking for already, thus my sectional organization of content by heading is intended to help people like you find exactly what you're after, or at the least help you skim through it more easily if nothing else.

You'll also probably want to set up some parental controls on their devices to limit what they can do and access.

I did look around briefly for something cheaper, but didn't find anything useful.

The FM and audio record are a really cool for music discovery.  I currently own a Zune 120 gig. The Zune pass is te best deal around. I haven't bought the Zune HD because I really don't care for apps on a mp3 player. I know apps are the cornerstone of the whole Apple experience. This is why apps are even coming to the Mac.

(Android based)   <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042RRTOC"">Archos 43 - 16 GB Internet Tablet (Black)</a>  The main reason is that I will be able to transfer files from the Archos (videos that I take with the built in HD camera) to my PC for editing and burning to DVD.  From what I understand, the Apples' iTune transfers files one way -- PC to IPOD.  Is this true?  If so, is there a work around?",1,0,,,,,,,,,
783,19,1,"Scott Showalter","Tracy: There are some add-on physical keyboards for the iPhone floating around. Namely: http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/01/thinkgeek-tk-421-iphone-keyboard-case-review  As far as what is greater, well that depends on your needs. I like Android for its widgets, its productivity leaning, and its near-seamless integration with Google services. But after playing with Best Buy's demo iPhone again recently, I was reminded how it is better: apps. There just aren't the high quality apps on Android that you see on iPhone. That's slowly starting to change with Angry Birds being ported, but progress is slow otherwise. EA, for example, has only ported one game. FAIL...  Thankfully the iPod touch fills the apps void for me, and if I had to choose between Android and iPhone for a ""phone"" I would be content (as I already am) with just an Android and my trusty iPod touch. If I had no iPod touch, is definitely have to go with the iPhone for sure.  I use the EVO 4G, which is equivalent to the Droid Incredible and Droid X. I didn't care for either of those equivalents though, because of their odd shapes, so thankfully I'm on Sprint.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

You can have any type of broadband (a.k.a. high-speed) internet, including cable or DSL, and set it up for use over WiFi. The key ingredient in doing this is a Wireless Router. The DSL company can probably set them up with one when they're out to install the service.  As far as other places, as long as the WiFi is available to the public, then yes, she would be able to use it there too.

793,19,0,"WLSinWI","A real fanboi review.     I was very disappointed in the new iTouch.  I decided not to buy one unless the price drops to match my disappointment.  Rather than blurring the lines between the Touch and Phone, Apple has gone some distance to make the Touch clearly second rate. First there is no GPS which I consider a necessity in this type of device.  A screen that is NOT same as the phone and is inferior. Less memory than the phone and a rear facing camera that is clearly inferior. Add in no vibrate module and a instant scratch back and if you already have an older Touch there is no reason to get one unless you have money to burn.",1,0,,,,,,,,,
794,19,0,"Scott Showalter","The Apple A4 processor is clearly a 1GHz CPU. Just because it clocks at under 1GHz doesn't make the processor any less than what it is. While I agree that the underclocking could make the 1GHz designation slightly misleading, Apple has generally been known to underclock their processors. To me though, processor quality is determined not just by speed, but also by the number of cores. So it will be interesting to see how the forthcoming dual core mobile chips will perform.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

798,19,0,"Family account","I read about 80 percent of your review, and at the end you forgot to mention the built in Mic. The retina display is 100 times better, but my fascinates' amoled screen is still the best screen I've seen on a phone or Itouch. I originally got a droidX but returned it within the 30 days when I saw a friends fascinate and if you hold them side by side with the X or Iphone, it's much better than both, plus, I got a thumb drive that you insert your Micro SD card in and you can transfer music from one card to another, even though the verizon store said they couldn't do the music. You can just drag and drop anything onto the sd card and all the folders are marked for what their supposed to be in. BTW, what you said about downloading android apps is totally wrong, once you setup your account it's just as fast to get an app as the iphone, in fact, it's faster because you don't have to type in a password. you just click the app, if it's free it downloads immediately, if it costs money, then when you click a page comes up showing you the price and you just click ok, and that's it. for research purposes, I just downloaded and bought an android app and I bought a Itunes app on my old one and the android did it a bit faster actually. however, on most of the apps I prefer apple's apps.  Spoofpro is awesome, my friend found something like it on his iphone but couldn't get it to work and it's not nearly the quality of spoofpro which is an android app that makes it where you can put in ANY number to show up on the caller id of the person your calling and it has 10 different voices to choose from, plus, you can record the conversations and upload them to youtube. Back to the Itouch, I love the Itouch and due to it's busted screen, I had to buy a new one and I got the 64GB 4th Gen. however, I lost my Itunes account in a fire when my computer burned up, my old one still works even the screen, Is it possible to get my stuff off my old ipod and get it back in my itunes account? I'm going to call apple about that.  In conclusion, I do like to have both a cellphone and an Itouch, but just barely.  If any of you are verizon customers when you go to the store look at the fascinates screen and hold it next to any other droid it's amoled display is amazing, the best screen I've ever seen. Plus I love that if you don't like the app you can get it refunded as long as you do it within a certain amount of time, the writer of this column said 24 hours, that sounds about right.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

However, given the customer service issues of dealing with a foreign company and also my probably being too casual a user to get to operate the Archos to its fullest (2 kids, 3rd coming), it's looking like I'm going to go with the Itouch 64 gig.  I apologize if I missed this in the article, but I'd be curious to read your comparisons between the 4th generation Itouch and the Archos 5.  Also, while the Itouch can communicate with a DVR, I'm wondering if you think it will ever gain the same capacity to link to a TV and be used as an actual DVR, like the Archos?

809,19,0,"Scott Showalter","Hey Rachael. Hilariously, we're still rocking a 10 year old CRT SDTV. The fanciest hookups of which are S-video. Thus, I haven't been able to connect any of these modern devices with TV outputs to it. Just reluctant to fix what aint broken, you know? I guess we're more likely to upgrade smaller devices more often than big ones.  So no, I haven't tried the Archos 5 mostly because I wouldn't be able to use it for all its worth. But from scouring the comments, there are lots of users reporting that the DVR dock is pretty worthless. I'm inclined to believe them myself, not because Archos is poor quality... they're generally fairly decent devices. I remember them being one of the first major competitors of the original iPod.  Just remember what I said in my review though... until higher quality developers start jumping onto the Android platform, the apps available for Android devices will be much lower quality that those available for the iPod and other iOS devices. Simple as that. Nothing against Android, just wish they'd have better apps/developers behind the platform. iPod touch does, so to me the choice is clear.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
810,19,0,"Scott Showalter","L. Arevalo: Absolutely, purchase the AppleCare protection for the iPod touch. If nothing else, it will help increase the resale value after the original one year warranty is up. However, with the unibody nature of the iPod touch, if you ever have to replace the battery, you'll need the AppleCare coverage to do it. You can purchase AppleCare right here on Amazon for cheaper than the retail price (link is in my review), but you have a year to get it. It must be purchased before the original warranty expires.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

Then once you have setup your new iPod, you can right click and choose ""restore backup"", selecting the latest backup record in the list to sync your backed-up apps, notes, music, etc over to the new iPod.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
812,19,0,"Scott Showalter","Hey Daphne. My best suggestion for your company, or anyone else interested in developing mobile apps is to look for someone reputable on elance.com or freelancer.com ...and by reputable, I mean someone with tons of positive feedback already out there. There are so many flakes in that industry that it's always best not to go with the cheapest developer, especially those who're new or those with little feedback.   I've heard too many horror stories about people/companies getting burned by new or cheap developers. They don't exactly loose a ton of money by choosing someone who's ""just starting out"" who has offered a super cheap rate... but half the time they do not get back what they put into the project initially if the project goes south, or they end up paying out way more than they initially expected due to poorly developed and buggy apps, or lack of features or polish in the end result.   Expect to pay $5000 on up for a decent app to be produced by a reputable developer. Also expect to put at least that same amount, if not more, into any kind of marketing for your apps if you want to stand out from the crowd in any way. The App Store is not the gold-rush it once was!  Unfortunately for you, I'm not accepting any new mobile development projects at the moment, otherwise I'd happily discuss things with you further. But I'm always happy to provide valuable advice to help you successfully navigate those oft cold, dark waters of outsourcing your mobile app development! :)",0,0,,,,,,,,,
813,19,0,"L. Arevalo","Scott, follow-up question if I may. We went to our local Apple store tonight and looked at the new touch. I was talking to the sales guy about the AppleCare plan and asked him to compare it to the extended warranty that Best Buy offers ($79 for 2 years vs. $59 for AppleCare). He said that the one thing Best Buy covers that they don't which would in his mind make it worth the extra $20 is that Best Buy covers ""accidental damage"" like if you drop it and crack the case or spill something on it. AppleCare does NOT. My wife and I will be sharing this new toy and are both somewhat klutzy so the chances are, at some point one of us will drop it. Do you have any thoughts about this or any experience with the Best Buy warrantee?  Thanks again for all you do!",0,0,,,,,,,,,

Your mileage may vary of course, and any one fall could always be the one that breaks something... that's just the nature of these things. But if I had to decide on purchasing at BBY with their warranty vs buying it here and getting the AppleCare, I would have to stick with buying it here on Amazon with the AppleCare. Getting both here on amazon would actually save me even more than just the $20 difference because of the discounts Amazon is naturally known for.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

Why doesn't someone address the (in my opinion) ridiculous requirement to pay monthly for a data plan when buying an iphone - or any smart phone? If Verizon or AT&T were to make the plan optional, allowing folk to rely on Wi-Fi if preferred, they would blow away their competition. Perhaps ""most"" people are happy to shell out the extra cash each month anyway, but I and a few others balk at being forced to pay for something I don't see as justified in value - for me. I'd rather join my PDA and phone into one device, but this ""screw folks when you can"" business approach so inflames me that I will choose the iPod over the iPhone, even at the same price, and continue to shake my fist at my service provider, while denying myself the device I would prefer.

But I think the bigger one is that they just aren't as consistently reliable or as good in quality as HD since they are basically only as good as the connection to whatever wireless Internet you happen to be lucky in latching on to, if any are available while.......... riding a bike, swimming at the lake, mountain hiking, or even sometimes just walking around normally.  Granted that I can agree with you that the radio won't be used 12 hours a day or two but when you have that itch for random music or the local news or even a droll talk show -HD Radio delivers because you do not have to worry about reception and you'll always know your favorite stations are easy to dial in on.

Well, because even with the one, and only one, obvious shortfall that chaps my @#$%^  every time Apple doesn't come through when they release a new version -It is still the best on the market in style, size, reliability, quality, & OS features. ^_^ I just want the radio.

843,20,1,"MWebb","More memory is always good, but when the unit gets too pricey I tend to treat it as a ""closet queen"" afraid to lose it, drop it, etc. It's nice to have a price point where the purchase decision can almost be ""what the heck"" and where you don't live in terror of losing or breaking it.

845,20,1,"MWebb","The price spread seems more like $60 or $70. I got mine for fifteen bucks off from the big blue store by asking them to price match that warehouse store. Discounts on the 32 gb aren't as great...yet. Yeah for $60-$70 it is MUCH better to get the 32 gb. You can never have too much memory...only too little money. I got the 8 gb because, as I said, it is at the neat intersection of my cheapness and minimalist curves. Keep in mind even 32 gb, or 64 gb, isn't much if you have a 500 gb home computer full of videos and music. So you are always going to have to make choices about what to keep on the Touch.  I just thought it would be an interesting challenge to see if, in the modern era, an 8gb can actually suffice and YES it does for my needs. Also by having less $$$ invested in it, I am less afraid to carry it around all the time, in a jacket pocket instead of safely (and inaccessibly) stowed in the depths of my day pack.  Why does the 8gb suffice? I only carry my favorite current favorite albums, which don't take up much storage space, even in the much larger ""lossless"" file format. I only carry a few videos - since they are instructional sports DVD's I need to watch them repeatedly, so a few hours can take weeks to get through. The rest is a book or two plus streams - Pandora or Slacker, YouTube, Netflix.  The Netflix app is right on the App store - just use the search function and type in Netflix, it should pop right up.  The 8gb is perfect if you are on a budget, or want one for your kid. Of course in 6 months the minimum size offered could well be 16 gb at the same price, but such is progress.  So my suggestion is: unless you are as quirky as I am, or on a tight budget, or plan on handing it down to a 6 y.o., get the 32 gb. But you won't be as crippled as you think, if you just get the 8 gb.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
846,20,1,"MWebb","Just an additional note. I don't see any performance difference on the 4th generation model vs. the last generation (32gb or up with faster chip). I am sure the faster chip works better if I multi-task (listen to Pandora via the Safari browser, while reading a book) but for my ""one app at a time"" approach I see no difference. Also the apparent difference in sharpness is negligible since the type is so small (compared to the iPad). (Of course matching resolution to the iPad should now mean that all iPad apps will work pm tje Touch without conversion, which is REALLY important.) If you had a last generation model with less than 32 gb the ""double upgrade"" in processor speed will probably be more noticeable. If you had a 32 gb and up 3rd gen you probably won't see a striking difference, what you gain in raw speed you lose in background apps (like Facebook updating). The last gen was noted for being quick already, after all....  The GREATEST single improvement is the addition of a built in microphone so you can use Skype in speakerphone mode if you don't have earphones handy. Also you can now use ANY earphones - you aren't stuck searching for a set with a built in microphone.  The next most important upgrade is the built-in video cameras. Don't know how I got along without these before! A video call is MUCH more than a vanity thing. It adds another dimension to old-fashioned phone calling.  If I had to choose between my older 3rd gen 32 gb and my new 8 gb, I'd choose the 8gb just for these improvements.  Don't underestimate the long term importance of the screen compatibility between the Pad and Touch. Right now developers are doing their best work for the Retina display. The new Touch may have smaller type, but it will be able to play the same games etc.  BTW does anyone know how to get a phone number so I can use this for incoming and outgoing text messages too? Maybe via Google Voice? Or Skype?",0,0,,,,,,,,,

In fact that is what I do - we gave up a land line years ago and use only cellphones. Sometimes for business calls you need better clarity than you get on a cellphone. On those occasions I use Skype with the iPod Touch and it is great. Fring is another application. Both of them allow free Skype to Skype or Fring to Fring calls on computers, but have a ""per minute"" charge for calling real telephones (like cellphones and land lines). Fring is much cheaper for international calls at this point, but Skype is well-proven.  Once again, this is NOT a cellphone so your question doesn't really apply.

I bought a Nook because the people at the local Barnes & Noble store went out of their way to help me with it.  With Barnes & Noble you get to talk to a real person and not an outsourced customer service representative who can only read a script to you.

I have bought literally like a thousand products from amazon kindle included and i have rarely ever had any bad experiences with them. My husband's kindle broke a few months ago and they were quick to have it replaced and he spent 30 minutes on the phone. Amazon do not repair kindles though, I can tell you that much, which leaves me thinking that you are overpaying for the reader to begin with. If they can replace the kindle just like that (and my husband's kindle had just a tiny hardware problem) to me that means that they are investing a minimal amount of money on every individual kindle and still racking up a whole lot of cash. Most companies will have you ship the broken device and charge some fee for the repair, even if its a small fee. My advice to you is to keep trying costumer service and hopefully you will get lucky. I have read some of these 1 star reviews stating how their kindle gets broken after they put the cover on it and it leaves me thinking that it is an user misuse, no offense to some people out there I just think some people thought they knew what they were doing before reading the actual instructions on how to put the cover. This is coming from a woman whose husband is prone to abuse electronic devices without mercy.

2079,80,1,"John Clifford","I second the Calibre recommendation... but there's even an easier way.  Set up a folder on your computer in the following structure: PDF, with subfolders for each category of document you want, e.g., 'Grants', 'Manuscripts', 'Other'. Copy the PDF files on your computer to the appropriate subdirectory. Then, drag the PDF folder to the 'Documents' folder on your mounted Kindle DX.   Keep your laptop's PDF directory tree organized and updated, and then drag it to your Kindle whenever you want to update it. If you want to make this more efficient (not having to delete/recopy everything or deal with the annoying 'Overwrite/Ignore' messages from Windows), download SyncToy from Microsoft and it will help you ensure that the Kindle mirrors your 'PDF' tree on your laptop, so you can update the laptop, invoke SyncToy, and when it's done the Kindle is up-to-date.  Note that this trick (setting up subfolders on a mounted Kindle under the 'Documents' directory) works for AZW books, PDFs, etc. I use it along with SyncToy to organize my public-domain ebooks by author. It doesn't help me navigate on the Kindle (you won't see the subfolders) but it does help me keep things organized and backed up easily on my PC, and makes it far easier to manage my Kindle's content.",1,0,,,,,,,,,

You could probably change the names of your PDF files to accomodate your preferred organization scheme.  On the mainscreen, you can view all of your documents, and you can choose to see them listed by name, or by the most recent accessed.

It is not perfect. I wish the screen was a little larger (A4 size) without the stupid location and other information always being displayed. As a result of the 9"" screen the font is SLIGHTLY smaller than normal. But, in English, Japanese, and Chinese I have had no problems.  I actually do not mind the lack of PDF functionality. At first, it really annoyed me that I couldn't take notes in my PDFs, highlight, etc., because that is what I used to do with paper versions / DTB (dead tree books).

2098,82,0.8375,"D. Hewes","I do not own any other eReader - but you obviously missed my point.  Amazon created a larger screened eReader with heavy advertising that it has native PDF support (Read the Amazon page - it is the first feature listed) and in almost every screen shot they show what would appear to be technical information, normally found in PDF format.  They are clearly attempting to state that this is the de facto standard for reading PDF's on an eReader.  Well, it is not.  The Kindle's ability to read PDF's...well...sucks.  The only way to zoom is to rotate the device and see half the page.  PDF's have many embedded features like links from Table of Content pages and Index pages - none of which are recognized by the Kindle.  Most PDF's include the actual text information (some are rendered as images - but can be OCR'd by Acrobat and re-saved).  Yet the Kindle does not have the ability to change the font size???  I was shocked when I first popped on my first PDF all excited...only to be greatly dissapointed.

2100,82,0.24050634,"Chei Mi Lane",". Other readers treat PDF's as any other document allowing all the same e-reader functions and there is no reason - short of not wanting to pay Adobe a license fee - that the Kindle does not have this same functionality.         these are your words, what other readers? If you mean on a PC or a laptop, that is not a competing product, and unless you get a large screen tablet, the reading is much tougher. Many of the PDF that are text based can be searched. Not all PDF's are image/page types. I have an iPod Touch, an ASUS netbook, a Samsung Tablet, a Sony500 reader, various PMPs and have also owned several Palm and PPC products. Palm and PPC were good for PDF due to reflow, but reflow was not the ultimate end. Several times in reflow the bottom of one page got bolluxed up with the top of the next one.     My bad on the iTunes. I misread it, and that is due to being older than you. I am certain of that. I retired ten years ago at the age of 42, now how about that? Why bring age into it?

2101,82,0.9484536,"D. Hewes","Chei Mi Lane -  You seem to want to make a huge deal out of my disappointment with the PDF capabilities of the Kindle.  Not sure why you are such a stark advocate of the device...I am sure you have your reasons.  Bottom line is this: Based on press releases, the Amazon specs/ads, etc. I purchased this device for the sole purpose of transferring several hundred engineering and tech manuals that come from niche distributors or manufacturers  (that will never be available via Whispernet in Amazon format)  to the device so that I could carry them with me from client to client and reference them as needed.  These books/manuals are all in PDF format and are almost all 500 pages or longer.  They include many circuit illustrations, logic flow charts, etc. which cannot be enlarged/zoomed in on with the Kindle.  For my intended purpose the device is a complete and total failure and I firmly believe that it is misrepresented by Amazon.  This is my opinion and my experience, and no matter what comment you can retort with, those facts will not change.   The lack of a folder structure just further aggravated the situation.  My other points are things I discovered along the way.  I do not want to convolute this point by bringing in discussions of other readers here and this is not relevant to the review - it just suffices to say that the Kindle is NOT an appropriate device for those looking to store and search PDF's.    Do not get me wrong - the device absolutely has it's purposes.  As I mentioned clearly in my review, it does do the traditional eReader thing right.  I have several books that I have purchased via Whispernet - and since they are native Amazon format they work fine.  If you intend to read a book in a linear fashion, or intend to use Whispernet delivered content, the device has a nice, large screen.  Surfing the web....ya, the novelty of that wore off in about 45 seconds.  I would grab my iPhone over my Kindle any day of the week for that.  I seriously intended to return the device, but instead decided that I would keep it and use it solely to read other books instead of the PDF's.   The Kindle DX is a decent eReader.  It is not, however, ready for the things that Jeff Bezos touted it for, including Professional Documents and Textbooks (Google the transcript of his unveiling, May 6, 2009 from about 10:42-10:52AM).  This was one of many occasions where he praised its ability to read, mark up, etc. ""Professional Documents"".  And as far as textbooks - yes, it has been 20 years since I graduated college, but I cannot imagine the pain of trying to use this device to read and note anything but maybe a Psych 101 textbook.    People that have never used an eReader that buy a Kindle DX to read books for pleasure will love the device.  That said, potential buyers have a right to know that the device is NOT appropriate for many of the things it is being advertised for.  I cannot be any more honest than that.  If you still disagree, than you have that right.  I am not sure what your agenda is though...  My sole intent is to give an honest assessment of the device and not just be sing praise at the altar of Bezos.  I would have appreciated the same prior to my purchase - however, I was one of the first to pre-order.  That was my mistake.",1,0,,,,,,,,,

2103,82,0.5272727,"Allan Tischler","I found this review to be interesting, but very misleading.  First, The main point made by Chei Mi Lane is valid. I felt the main new point that I had not come across before your review was the claim that not only doesn't the K-DM allow any control over any aspect of books in the PDF format, but that OTHER READERS can. When this was pointed out not to be the case, all you do is put down Chei Mi. That's neither polite nor helpful.  Other points you make are also just not true--at least for the Kindle 1. All Mobi (or PRC) formatted books are completely compatible with the Kindle. Were you not aware that Amazon OWNs Mobibook? Well over 95% the 1200+ books on my Kindle are in Mobi format, not the Kindle's AZW format. All of these books were easily obtained on line, most of them for free. [All you've got to do is look.] Those that already in Mobi format were just moved from my computer onto the Kindle. Others, including hundreds of books I downloaded in PDF format were readily converted into Mobi format with free software (Mobipocket Creator). The vast majority of these converted PDF books read like all other books on the Kindle, including contol over font size, word searches, dictionary lookup, etc.  Some of your points are completely valid. For example, the lack of being able to add an SD chip for extensive storage. The Kindle 1 does allow such card use and I agree that dropping it in the two newer Kindles is lamentable. This is especially the case given the apparent reason for dropping this feature, which is that Amazon cannot accesss (and therefore delete) any books stored on the SD card. They can only do so from the Kindle drive.  The net value of your review is greatly reduced by the uneven veracity of the claims you make. Thank you Chei Mi for pointing out that the limitations of reading native PDF books on the K-DM is no worse than on many other readers. Once again, Most PDF books converted by Mobipocket Creator are as accessible on the Kindle as any other book in Kindle format.",1,0,,,,,,,,,
2104,82,0.9677419,"D. Hewes","Mr. Tischler:  On your first point, I agree that my particular perspective was not clearly expressed in my original review.  Amazon touted this device as having NATIVE PDF capabilities.  That cannot be further from the truth.  On my iPhone I can zoom in/out, make notes both via text and finger-painting style, click on TOC links, do full context searches, open password protected PDF's, etc.  There are several App Store apps that can do this - I use the AJI one specifically.  The Kindle DX basically renders each page as a static image with no ability to do anything other than zoom like any other static image.  It has no ""READER"" capabilities.  Not a single PDF function actually works.  I do not own any other eReader or previous version of the Kindle.  I have read that the Sony and other models do a better job with PDF's, but can only compare to the iPhone 3G and 3GS that I own.  My main goal in this point was to convey to potential buyers that the advertising campaign is extremely misleading - and that if you (like I) purchase the Kindle DX for the specific purpose of reading PDF's you will be greatly disappointed.  That point remains absolutely true today.   I apologize to Chei Mi, but on first reading I took the comment as an attack based on tone, and I may have misinterpreted that.  For that I am sorry.   In regards to other points I make being untrue I need to respectfully ask, ""Do you own a Kindle DX?""  I do not own any previous versions of the Kindle, so I cannot compare and contrast.  I am aware that Amazon owns MobiBooks.  I concede that I was partially mistaken on the .mobi/.prc (same file type) point.  The Kindle DX does support unencrypted .mobi/.prc files.  The .modi files I was attempting to use were MobileBooks DRM protected.  I had previously purchased a ""Classics Collection"" of a couple hundred books in .mobi format for a smartphone I owned and they were not/are not readable on the Kindle DX without using a quasi-illegal third party tool to strip the DRM.  Amazon's ownership of MobileBooks makes this point all the more puzzling.  Upon last checking, the Kindle DX conversion service from Amazon still does not convert DRM protected .mobi/.prc books.  Since they own MobileBooks, this should irritate users even more.  Again, my original point still remains 100% valid - there is zero support for extremely common formats like .chm.  I have an account with several technology related publishers, like O'Reily, that offer downloads in .chm format that I cannot use on the Kindle DX.  The .lit format is very common on free download sites as well and cannot be used without third party conversion tools.  So other than unencrypted .mobi books, your comment is inaccurate.  There are absolutely countless unencrypted eBooks in .mobi/.prc that can be downloaded and read on the Kindle DX - which does a user absolutely no good if the title he/she needs is in a DRM protected format, as are most current titles offered in that format - at least in the categories I need.  This further strengthens my argument that the Kindle DX is not useful for its advertised use as a ""Professional"" or ""Student"" device, but remains a strong candidate for the recreational reader  You make an interesting point converting .pdf to .mobi.  First, this requires a third party tool.  Second, I have yet to successfully convert while retaining all of the .pdf capabilities - like linked TOC/Index.  Third, and again, as advertised the Kindle DX fully supports .pdf's out of the box - so why should I spend a month converting my 5,000 PDF's for a month when I am supposed to be able to use them without conversion?  So let's say I have a Word document (aka, ""Professional Document""), print it out as a PDF with all formatting, links, etc. intact.  Then I have to convert to .mobi - losing all of those features, just to read on a device that was advertised and sold to me as being capable of reading ""Professional Documents"".  Again, this further highlights the differences in a device intended for the Professional versus Recreational reader.  For your needs this may absolutely work great.  For my needs (high volume of documents where formatting is actually critical for the content that are released and updated frequently) it is not a viable option.  If you have a lower volume of static content with context sensitive diagrams and charts, then the .mobi format does allow you to use the many features (text resize, dictionary lookup, etc.) that Amazon leads a potential buyer to believe are functional with PDF's in the first place. As an engineer I understand that a prototype often is modified more by accounting than by R&D.  Someone may have determined that the SD card reader had the highest failure incident rate of any component and hence it was removed from the DX.  Could have just been a cost thing.  As far as accessing content on an SD card, that is a software function that Amazon could have addressed if desired.  In any case, it would have been nice.  But hey - my iPhone doesn't have one either (though it is 32GB).

While its true that the browser provided is quite basic, and that Amazon reserves the right to end this free access at any time, I've now had it for about two full years and that makes the Kindle overall a real bargain.

2112,82,0.93333334,"Allan Tischler","To afb,  I have been recommending to folks that the best buy (and the best e-reader) of the Kindle family is the original Kindle, now often referred to as 'Kindle 1' or just K1.  I have mentioned some of these reasons in my two previous posts in this discussion. New K1s are still available new on sites like eBay and Craigslist for well under $200. Unlike its two successors the K1 has a replaceable battery that is easily purchased from third parties for about $20. It's also the only Kindle that allows you to add an SD card that in turn allows you to collect a virtually unlimited number of eBooks. Also noteworthy about this ""open architecture"" feature is that Amazon is unable to police content that you place on the SD card. The number of eBooks available for free, including contemporary eBooks, is staggering. A growing number of authors care more about the number of people their book has reached than the number of dollars collected. [I have approximately 1,500 eBooks on my K1 so far, and I've only purchased a few of dozen of them-plus subscriptions.] Moreover, it is very easy to convert other formats, especially PDF, to Mobipocket format (.PRC or .MOBI) using the freeware utility, Mobipocket Creator. These Mobipocket formats are 100% compatible to and interchangeable with Amazon's .AZW format. In fact, Mobipocket dot com (now owned by Amazon) offers upwards of 12,000 free eBooks that can be downloaded. Other sites that contain eBooks in Mobipocket (or .AZW) format can likewise be directly downloaded. ManyBooks dot net and FeedBooks dot com are but 2 examples.  The great majority of PDF books are converted by Mobipocket Creator to reasonably compatible Kindle formats. I would estimate that about 80% of the eBooks on my Kindle are eBooks converted from .PDF format. They are generally searchable, their font size can be changed, pages can be bookmarked and phases can be highlighted and/or commented on. The only drawbacks are that internal hyperlinks are sometimes lost and figures are only rendered in 4 shades of gray.   Lastly as I've mentioned before, all Kindles offer free wireless Internet content, an EXTREMELY useful and valuable service. The Kindle browser is unsophisticated but serviceable. Of course Amazon reserves the right to start charging for this service, but it's been free for 2 years now. At the typical rate for wireless Internet of $70/month, this feature alone would pay for the Kindle 1 in less than 3 months. My best guess is that the free Internet service will remain so for the significant future, in part since the Kindle DX has fallen pretty flat--they need this feature if they are to win the e-Reader sweepstakes.   In summary, my opinion is that the Kindle 1--while it lasts--is the best Kindle of all from both a cost and feature point of view. It has a few quirks like being to easy to turn pages, but one rapidly gets used to it. I'm very glad that I have one and have no desire to trade-up. It alone offers unlimited storage (most of which Amazon can't access) and simple battery replacement.",1,0,,,,,,,,,

I'm going to forward it on to my neighbor.  He is shopping for an ebook device for his girlfriend, and I think your suggestion absolutely fits his bill.  Unfortunately, for me...I have this nasty philosophical side that says that in all Amazon's later Kindle products that their focus has been more on ""locking them down"" and locking the ""market"" down rather than giving their loyal customers the best product possible.    I give them major kudo's for being out there first.  I also want to deal with Amazon because I have been a huge fan for a long time and spent major bucks with them on everything from books to kitchen knife sets to lamps for my vision impaired mom.  AND gotten great deals!  I want them to live up to my expectations.  BUTT, They sucked off Wells and Rand books without telling any customers they were going to do that. To me that's like breaking into my house at night an stealing my book off my nightstand.   (there is actually a law suit going on.)  Maybe it's just a weird coincidence that these were controversial books, but later I've found out that they've sucked off Harry Potter and a cookbook.  And, the cookbook was definitely after they apologized and said they wouldn't do it anymore.  I don't like the fact that they even retain that capability.    As much as I want to stick with Amazon, I keep coming back to these conversations because there are people like you and D. Hewes who have more technical knowledge than I do, and seem to be very conscientious about commenting.   Very simply, I want the best technical product out there that gives me the best access to information.    Thanks.

I read an article in my hometown paper 2 weeks ago about the federal government giving the state of Oregon a grant to allow public libraries to purchase and lend ebooks.

2124,82,1,"D. Hewes","I have not seen the Que in person, but looking at the reviews and videos found/linked on engadget.com, and their own website, this seems to be everything a B/W eReader wants to be when it grows up.  Support for Word/Excel/PowerPoint and native support for PDF, paper sized screen (contributing to the additional costs), etc.  It seems at least Plastic Logic has been reading the complaints about the Kindle on the Amazon forums (even if Amazon has not been).  If it works as advertised, it is worth every penny.  Now that said, since I own a Kindle DX, there isn't much motivation to move on something unless it is revolutionary.  For me, that means color.  e-ink does have color flavors, but they are limited, expensive and poor quality.  The CES samples of better, faster color all had end of 2010 retail date estimates.  A large screen with color and a 3G connection may be perfect for magazines as well as everything else.  I admit this technology as a whole is still new, and still catching on.  It may actually take another generation before the mainstream users no longer care anything about ""printed material"".  But hey, one can dream.  Speaking of dreams, another possible solution may be the rumored Apple Tablet being announced this week (maybe, with Apple you never really know until Steve's presentation is COMPELTELY finished...with his ""Oh, one more thing"" signature line...).  Bottom line - regardless of what I or anyone thought when I first wrote this initial review, the Kindle DX - once itself revolutionary, is now old technology.  If it works for you and you can pick one up cheap than it is what it is - don't expect updates since none were released during its viability period, none are likely to be released in its legacy period.  Amazon's most likely move is to release an updated model and expect owners to pony up the $500+ to replace the DX in the 4th quarter of this year.  The marketplace is very different today than it was a year ago.  I would have a difficult time justifying the Kindle DX in its current form today with so many viable alternatives.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
2125,82,1,"Grinznmore","I think your announcement is a bit premature but we shall see. I'm sure Amazon will respond and will be more than happy to put their Kindle App on the iPad. I will probably get one because I'm a gadget guy but will still use my beloved,portable,affordable,comfortable to read Kindle 1 -- which I just purchased another for my daughter as a Christmas gift for $190. Like Steve said, they're standing on Amazon's shoulders with this product. For example, the no contract is clearly do to Amazon's pioneering model. It was Amazon who developed the market. Amazon is smart and innovative. You seem to think of yourself as a reality thinker. You don't really think the average iPad purchase will be $550 do you? Just a $100 more, just a $100 more, just a $100 more...   Let's see $830 for iPad, $360 annual data plan (not incl all those hidden charges by phone company), cover (who knows but let's guess $75, Charging Station Keyboard when you get tired of wiping finger oils off the screen (yes, I have an iPhone and get tired of the smudges) guess $150. So using my iPhone app that comes to $1,455 not including taxes and additional fees. DX at $500 does not look so dead to me. That's a lot of margin for the next product to work with. You can bet Apple is looking at $1,500 per customer -- not $500. Figure the average annual cost of owning an iPhone per year. That should give you an idea of the REAL cost of an iPad. Mr Hewes, don't get all giddy on us now and leave reality.  To those who want an e-book reader and don't get suckered into more features than you really want, the Kindle 1 at $190 or the Kindle 2 at $260 is a much more sane choice than a device that will not be as portable (not sticking this in your small bag, bright shiney difficult to read screen and twice as much or more. In my view, they do not compete. One other thing, get your spray bottle ready to wipe the oils off the pages of your ""book.""",1,0,,,,,,,,,
2126,82,1,"D. Hewes","Grinznmore:    First, let me give Amazon some credit.  The original Kindles did in fact set a totally new bar for eReaders and proved they were a viable device in the marketplace.  My issue is with the DX specifically and how it was marketed versus it's abilities.  Things like horrible PDF functionality and lack of folders would have been trivial to fix, yet they never did.  I am sure that they will have an answer to the iPad soon - which may be a DX replacement instead of software upgrade.  They have nothing to lose and everything to gain by recompiling the existing Kindle app for iPhone (that WILL work on the iPad right now) for the larger format instead of using the iPad zoom feature.  With this they will sell content, which is their mainline business anyhow.  I fully intend to purchase Kindle content on the iPad.  In regards to costs there are two different sets of users.  You and I will buy the $829 version the day it comes out - and will use it as a reader and so much more.  But for people that are in the market for an eReader for no other reason (at least at first) than to read, the $499 iPad versus the $489 Kindle DX is no match.  Now, at $199 the DX may still hang in there.  Those people will not get the 3G plan, just sync with a PC or buy the card reader shown on the Apple web site that plugs into the charging/sync port.    Ya, I admit that I was a little ""fanboy"" during the presentation.  The iPad still has no flash support and no camera, but that is not important to purist eReader buyers.  If you are looking at large format eReaders then the Plastic Logics, Kindle DX and low end iPad will make your short list.  The iPad, I believe, will win out.  The Kindle 1/2 is a different group entirely and I do not think the iPad will cut in to those sales.  Those will still do fine.  People that step up to the DX did so for PDF support, more memory, larger/clearer screen.  The iPad slams the Kindle DX on those points.  Then the iPad has about 140,000 other reasons to buy it right now (number of apps in the App Store) plus however many get released specific for the iPad.  Make no mistake, Amazon is not stupid.  Lack of a viable alternative made them lazy.  With a 90 day window until the release of the iPad I would not be surprised to see price cuts and software improvements on the DX.  The reality though is that the Kindle DX and the iPad - even in its cheapest form - are no real match today.  If all you want is Kindle DX functionality, then the only advantages of it over the lowest end iPad is that you do not need a computer, Kindle DX has much longer battery life and Kindle DX includes wireless for free.  However I feel that buyers of a DX will most likely have a computer, be willing to charge everyday and can sync with the computer or use wireless 802.11 to surf for content.  I have an iPhone and an iPod Touch and the screen smearing is not a major issue, especially during periods of time when I would be reading an eBook on a Kindle.  The phones obviously get touched all day long.  Bringing us back full circle:  If you are looking to buy a large format eReader - nothing else, just an eReader - what are the viability arguments in support of a DX versus the entry level iPad with today's prices and features?",1,0,,,,,,,,,

Your review on the other hand has been exceptionally helpful.  I did not buy the original Kindle because it did not seem suitable for reading technical books and papers.  With the Kindle DX, I thought maybe e-readers had finally become useable for my needs, and the Kindle DX advertising definitely led me to believe that also.  I'm glad I came across your review, because it has saved me $500 and a great deal of frustration.  It is obvious the Kindle DX is still not the e-reader I'm looking for.  I have hundreds of technical papers and text books in pdf format that I had hoped to put on the DX, but with no file structure and poor pdf functionality, the DX is sadly lacking.    I appreciate too the many thoughtful comments others have posted.",1,0,,,,,,,,,
2131,82,1,"Leshiy","D.Hewes: Your statement about better alternative e-ink readers for PDF is misleading, and could cost someone time spent in futile search. A year after Kindle DX release, there is still NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE available for under $1000. That is, any e-ink reader with a screen large enough to view technical papers and books, or, in general, any pdf that has illustrations. Unless, of course, you are willing to go back to backlit LCD. There were several promising large readers announced last year (Plastic Logic Que being most prominent, but also models from Pocketbook, ASUS, Hanlin,etc), but they all seem to keep getting delayed to infinity. IREX DR1000 is the aging pioneer, but it costs over $1000. IREX DR800 has 8'' screen and does not support landscape mode properly on top of that. You mentioned Sony readers. Their PDF handling features are much better than DX's, and their processing speed is comparable. However, the largest one only has a 7'' screen. Plus, their touchscreen greatly reduces contrast and increases glare, thus negating the main advantage of e-ink (saving your eyes). Seriously, could you consider updating or qualifying ""there are better options out there"" statement in your review? Your top-rated negative review has a lot of impact.  A month after release of Ipad, a used US-only Kindle DX still fetches $380-$390 on Ebay auctions, and the trade volume is quite high (I have been checking auction outcomes for a couple of weeks). Also, no indication from Amazon about lowering the price. Apparently you were wrong about Ipad killing this product. I am by no means gloating. I'd love to be able to buy a used DX at a deep discount from some Apple ...enthusiast in need of Ipad financing. Ipad and e-ink readers target different audience and usage. DX has more of a niche audience and purpose, but Ipad clearly did not steal it.   Admittedly, for your purpose of reference lookup while on the go, talking to clients, Ipad is better. For that matter, a full-featured tablet is probably better than Ipad. If the advantage of e-ink is non-existent or unimportant to you, why did you purchase DX in the first place?  DX does have problems, as you've mentioned. The biggest ones are are the lack of support for highlighting and notes, the lack of stylus touchscreen to make location selection for those tasks efficient, and deficient file organization options. The lack of zoom is not much of an issue, because in landscape mode DX pretty much displays in full printed page size. Also, Amazon has been unwilling to update their firmware to address user concerns and feedback. Unfortunately, there are currently no alternatives, just old-school paper. After checking out a friend's DX and doing some research, I decided to wait until competitor devices were released. Five months later, I've wasted many more trees printing my reading materials, DX price is the same, and no alternative product seems close to being released. I'm not sure if I'll takethe plunge now, but if I could go back, I'd definitely buy it.",1,0,,,,,,,,,

2134,82,1,"D. Hewes","The sad thing in my opinion is that this product could have been so much more.  The simple addition of a micro card reader as on the other Kindle models would have been a minimal manufacturing cost.  The software update to correctly handle PDF's and create folders would have been even less.  Amazon had the early lead and could have dominated - yet chose to be lazy and ignore thousands upon thousands of customers who have posted my identical concerns all over the Internet.  At this point you will have two types of consumers for this class of product.  The power users that want more functionality and the niche users who are perfectly content with the simple ability to read on a lightweight device for casual purposes.    Power users, including myself, have all jumped ship and purchased an iPad.  In my many years of buying every gadget that has been released - 90% of them ending up in a drawer somewhere after a few days - I can say that the iPad is far and away the best one I have ever owned.  Opinions will differ, but that is mine.  The irony is that my Kindle for iPad client renders my Whispernet content far better than the Kindle DX ever did.  Even if you buy the lowest end iPad and just use that one app for reading eBooks you would be much happier.  The die-hard eBook reader fans will form a significantly smaller group.  These are now split across Kindle, Nook and several others.  My former Kindle DX is now in the hands of a woman in NY thanks to eBay.  I wish her the best with it.

If I can't easily display and read PDF's, Word & Excel docs and any other format (.txt, etc.), the reader is not very useful to me.  That there is no easy exchange between my computer and the device adds to it's silliness.  These features could be added at little cost, so I believe that Amazon's business model is to go the proprietary route.  Apple did that with the Mac and now have barely 2% of the computer market, in spite of their laudable creativity and marketing success with other devices.  The Kindle may go the same way.  At some point, one of the e-reader marketer is going to produce a reasonably-priced unit with these features and a better viewing screen.  Kindle will be left forever in the dust.",1,0,,,,,,,,,

Well, that is no surprise. It is in fact impossible to change font size in a pdf document. A pdf is a fixed document, and one can only change the zoom. Adobe Acrobat cannot chage font size either. The fault is not in the Kindle, it's part of the very nature of the pdf.",1,0,,,,,,,,,
2140,82,0,"D. Hewes","Kjetil Kringlebotten - Yes and no.  To be more specific, I would have liked variable zoom functionality.  There were two Kindle options - show the full page, or show half the page zoomed.  That is rediculous.  Now, as far as being a fixed thing, like an image, that is entirely not correct.  It depends on how the document is rendered to PDF.  If you print from Word to PDF, or you use the full Acrobat Pro to OCR a scanned document, or a number of other methods than the text is in fact text - not static images.  Technically using the Text Edit tool you can change the size of the font in Acrobat Pro.  Again, my point was more a variable zoom function.  Things like cut and paste, highlight, ---SEARCH---, dictionary lookup, etc. should be VERY easy.  Every other app does this.  If you are a die hard Kindle fan, great!  Im happy for you.  But please dont try to make it seem like I was saying something I didnt.  Also, I pointed out 100 shortcomings and font size in PDF is your one issue?

2141,82,1,"D. Hewes","First - as I have long since sold my Kindle DX and replaced it with an iPad, this will be my final reply on this comment thread.  Bailey, each person that buys a product has their individual reasons.  The buyer's experience and opinion of the product are a direct correlation between what the buyer's expectations were versus what the actual experiences are.  I watched the initial presentation, read the initial advertising and had some fairly realistic expectations.  Keep in mind that when this was released the HUGE feature that was being touted was in fact PDF support, making it a ""business tool for professionals"".  That rhetoric has since been tamed greatly.   In the ads, they would go directly from full context searches to viewing a PDF...but guess what: there was no search option in a PDF.  Ever try to find the paragraph you need in a 3,000 page technical reference manual?  They bragged about how many documents/books it could store.  No one who has ever touched a computer would have fathomed that these would be simply dumped into a flat folder and you had to scroll 16 titles at a time.  I could go on, but I think I have beaten the dead horse more than enough.  I expected a product that worked with the features they demonstrated and alluded to in their advertising.  I received none of those.  For my purpose the product was an utter failure.  It was entirely unusable.  I am one of those business professionals their ads identified - an engineer that needs to reference hundreds of different technical manuals in a completely random order based on what problem is in front of me.  I had far better luck doing this on my iPhone than my Kindle DX - and that is saying a lot since that is a painful experience.  If Amazon had advertised this as a large format eBook reader with some additional ""extras"" - and included the PDF reader in the same group that they include the web browser in (experimental) I would not have purchased it.  However, if I had my expectations would have been set accordingly and I would probably have been happy with it.  Think about it.  If you go in to a car dealership looking for a vehicle that can go 500 miles per tank, carry 500 pounds of cargo and tow a trailer and you are sold a Prius you would be very unhappy.  Does that mean the Prius is garbage?  Well, many owners would say no.  However, the owners that are happy with it were not told that it would do those things.  Plain and simple.  You have the right to interpret the rating system any way you choose, as do I.   I choose to use the system to rate a product's actual experience versus what it is advertised to do.  On that count, the Kindle DX, given the ads at the time I purchased it, was a solid 1-Star product.",1,0,,,,,,,,,

One can only imagine the crap that gets throw in the truck and add a little G forces to that mix, one can only imagine the outcome.  Its probably even worse when the trunks empty as the thing slams around at every turn.  You can be the most careful driver in the world but once you mention trunk to a customer service rep their automatically going to blame it on you.   Then again in my eyes,  if you shell out $500 plus for the machine and $50 for the protective case, it should be able to hold its own in the trunk, unless you hauling bricks.  It seems like it is fairly flimsy, something you need to watch like a hawk.  It seems with one slip of the hand and that thing goes falling to the floor that would be the end of it.  I am considering getting the DX but I tend to drop things from time to time.  My cell phone has bounced off the ground countless times but it has yet to break. With this $500 Kindle it seems like there are no mulligans allowed.  One drop and your out.    Its good to hear Amazon did the right thing by you.  I have done a good amount of business with then, mostly books.  They have always done right by me the few times I have dealt with them regarding damages.  If you get a chance after using the new unit they send you update your review based on the sturdiness of the unit itself.  If this thing is so sensitive it can't handle a ride in the trunk of a car in a protective case, then it sounds like it would be smart for me to wait till a sturdier model comes out, one that can handle the average fall.  $500 is a lot of money to lose in a 2 second slip up.

However, you should be aware that if you have to look at a lot of mathematics, then the resolution and page size can be a problem.  You'll be forced to turn the device into landscape mode which isn't a perfect solution.  Here are a couple of things they should do to improve the Kindle DX.    1) Make it possible to use the 5-way switch to navigate hypertext links in a pdf.    2) It would be helpful to have a menu option to let you navigate the pdf's table of contents and page thumbnails.  They're already in the document!  It should not be that much extra work.  I suspect that the pdf reader was rushed to get the DX to market ahead of the PlasticLogic reader.  Perhaps a future update will make this possible.    3) Zoom and pan of the pdf page.  Something like a magnifying glass mode that can be controlled with the 5-way controller switch would be an improvement.

When their S90 review said ""As with the LX3, Canon has chosen to incorporate a relatively large (1/1.7"", 0.43 cm┬▓) sensor"", I think they meant only that both cameras incorporate large sensors (for point-and-shoots), not that they incorporate the same sensors.  Dpreview lists the LX3 sensor as being 1/1.63"" in size, different from the S90.  Furthermore (correctly or incorrectly), dpreview's S90 review attributed the S90's lack of HD video to its sensor, which wouldn't make sense if it had the same sensor as the HD-video-capable LX3.  Finally, consider this line from dpreview's comparison of the Raw Noise of the S90, G11, TL500, and LX3 in their TL500 review:  ""This test is a perculiar (sic) one in that three of the four cameras in this comparison almost certainly use the same sensor.

The faster cards are useful in DSLRs because they generate very large RAW files (about 1 MB per megapixel, in my experience), so they have the large memory buffers and they have the ability to pump a lot of data onto the card quickly.  The S-95's RAW files are about 10 MB and the JPEGS are a lot smaller (depending on the quality level you select.)

2547,106,0,"Michael Sandman","dsrapa --- There are some good ""enthusiast"" cameras like the Powershot S95 that will give you excellent images, but when you use flash with any  camera, even a DSLR, if your flash is fixed to the camera you'll get harsh shadows.  Either you have to shoot with available light using a fast lens and a high ISO setting or you have to use a separate, more powerful flash with a translucent diffuser to spread the light a bit and reduce the sharp shadows.  The flash on the S-95 is not very powerful, but Canon makes an add-on flash for it.  Because it has a fairly fast lens and takes good images up to about 800 ISO, you may not need a flash very often.  The Panasonic LX-5, Canon G-12 and Nikon Coolpix 7000 are also worth a look.  You can attach a good external flash to the Panasonic LX-5 and like the Canon S-95, the Panasonic has a fast lens.  It's just not as pocketable.   The Canon G-12 has the ability to take an external flash too, but it's definitely not pocketable IMHO.

Therefore, I wish I could place it face-up without worrying about scratches on the display.

Each new camera version improves upon the previous version, that is why most of us keep buying a new camera every year or so. The S95 blows away other small subcompacts that I own but it has it serious quirks. The one most people complain about is the flash. I've had the same problem and can't find a good hold to avoid the flash. It's really a poor design flaw. Each camera has its compromises and this one is no exception. To my knowledge there is no better subcompact camera available today with better low light specs. I like my ZS6 more than the S95 because it's nicer to hold but has poor low light capability. If you look at all the reviews most people are very happy with their very inexpensive P & S cameras because they all take nice snaps. The bottom line is the S95 is a great camera compared to the competition but it should be tried out first if you can before purchasing.

I would love a faster camera too. The most annoying thing about the UI lag for me is when you switch modes, it seems to really want to display a billboard with helpful info about the mode you just selected before letting you actually do any further UI stuff.

2573,108,0,"Roger James","I miss the optical viewfinder too because taking a picture using the LCD screen requires a big change in how you take pictures. SLR users will have the greatest challenge. However there is a big benefit to using the LCD screen...you have 100% view, can see tell if exposure is right with the histogram, and exposure info can improve picture taking. It does require a change in technique to take a great shot but the lcd in most cases is vastly superior to the incredibly crappy viewfinders they were putting on the smaller subcompacts. The subcompact from Canon as good as they were had horrible viewfinders but were required when LCD screens were difficult to view in bright sunlight. The LCD screen on the S95 can be viewed in bright light even with sun shining on it with a little twist can be easily viewed.  The S95 is not perfect and it may not be possible to make a camera this small perfect for any amount of money due to ergonomic considerations. I think it is the best in its class for this size camera. There are 100 cameras much better than this camera but they are all much bigger or bigger and more expensive.

After rereading David Pogue's review and lurking in the professional photographer forums, I finally opened it up to take on a trip to the Middle East. All I can say is this camera is amazing. I understand now why so many pros claim that the PS95 is the camera they always have with them. I am not a pro so I left it set to auto the entire time. It automatically set good lighting and focus for almost every photo I took. When I did closeups it automatically went into portrait mode. The image quality is fantastic. And it was fast enough for me. I did not bother w/ video; I use my Flip. To get better quality, you need to carry around one of those big, heavy SLR's. I carry my Powershot 95 and Flip w/ extra batteries and tiny tripod for both in a small purse. Never miss a shot. btw I adjusted fast to not impede the flash which I mostly keep turned off. The only criticism I have is that there is no manual. Only the pdf. I am waiting for one of those ""How to Use Your PS95"" books to come out. I want to learn about all those features of this extraordinary camera.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

One thing that's always bothered me was the lack of dynamic range (which I never noticed till I got a D40).  The colors were great, the portability was great, I still have and shoot with a Canon SD880 and SD550.  How's the dynamic range on the S95?  Is it truly DSLR quality?

2581,109,1,"Surfseventy8","Personally, I have issues with the lack of dynamic range on all digital cameras, even my D700.  I am primarily a film shooter.  Since film is so versatile, I've gotten far too used to having sky and ground and bright and shadowy areas all perfectly exposed.  As far as the S95 goes, I think it falls within my ""acceptable for digital"" standards.  Keep in mind though that I have yet to shoot RAW due to lack of support in CS5 and Lightroom.  I think that once that option becomes available, there will be greater latitude in shooting tougher lighting situations.  I plan on doing a more thorough test of the built in HDR in the coming week.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
2582,109,0.5,"Marvin Israel","I was struck by your saying ""My other camera is a Nikon D700 with a huge, heavy lens that I hate to take out just because of its size."" My first camera was a tiny Konica/Minolta which fit into a shirt pocket. Experience with that made me want a larger zoom range, so my next camera was a Canon S3Is. I wanted to be able to take decent pictures in relatively low light so next I got a Nikon D300 with the 18-200 lens. After using a borrowed Nikon 70-200 f2.8 pro lens, I saw that I needed that to get the instantaneous and perfectly accurate autofocus and the pleasing bokeh (blurred background) that the pro lens offered. I also saw that to get wide-angle and telephoto shots without the bother of changing lenses and losing the shot, that I needed two camera bodies, so I got a Nikon D700 with a 17-35 lens. On trips and NYC street shooting expeditions, that is what I have hanging on me. Why? Because to get the candid head and shoulder people shots I'm after plus the occasional touristy monument or scenic shot, that is what I need. My point is that you could not have made that remark about your D700 being too heavy to carry had you carefully thought out why you needed it in the first place. My advice to people is to think about what kind of shots you want to take and what kind of quality they need to be before buying a camera. A good strategy is to rent a DSLR and lens before buying.",1,0,,,,,,,,,
2583,109,1,"Surfseventy8","Don't get me wrong, I love my D700.  I shoot professionally with it.  I also shoot with Hasselblads and 8x10 field cameras.  I shoot Polaroids on my SX-70 as well as taking photos on my iPhone.  The point being that the best camera is the one you have with you.  You can't get into concerts with a big DSLR and I certainly wouldn't shoot professional portraits with my Holga.  Each camera serves different purposes.  For someone like me who takes photos every single day and can't take a huge camera to my day job, this camera is a perfect companion.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
2584,109,0,"J.G","Me again.  Most DSLR owners who complain about the size of their gear have, of course, a huge camera and a huge lens so of course it's a lot of weight.  For those of you who aren't DSLR owners but are thinking about it, remember that you can get a small DSLR (with a DX-sized sensor--smaller than a full frame sensor like the D700 et al but waaaay bigger than a point and shoot sensor).  My Nikon D40 with an 18-55 VR kit lens is an example.  ""Lightweight"" at around 950 grams (probably less than half of the D700 with similar lens?) so much so it's no more problem for me to take it around town than one of my point and shoots.  So carrying it around is never a problem.  Add 2 or more pounds around my neck and, yeah, I'd be lusting after relief in the form of an S95.  But the original poster of this review of his S95 doesn't have a D40 with 18-55 VR to fall back on so, of course, the S95 is a complete relief.  I'm getting an S95 soon just to see how it competes with my D40.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
2585,109,1,"Surfseventy8","For the most part, I have no complaints about the weight of my D700, it's the size.  I couldn't get into a ""no professional photography allowed"" concert any easier with a lightweight D40 than I could with a D3 and a 70-200.  Professional photographers have also been the victims of unnecessary and unlawful harassment by law enforcement.  Recently, I was escorted from a train station by a security guard and threatened with fines and jail time.  This was all because I took a photo of my children with my D700 as a train went by.  I was accused of being a terrorist for no reason other than that I was taking photos with a huge camera.  Meanwhile, there were at least 10 other people within 50 ft who were taking photos with point and shoots or cell phone cameras.    Sometimes it's not convenient, safe or possible to shoot with certain cameras.  Also, if you had a proper camera strap, you could carry a D700 and a big lens and it would feel only 1/3 as heavy as it would if you were using the supplied Nikon strap.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
2586,109,1,"Marvin Israel","One place where pro-looking cameras are not allowed is in the Moscow subway. Also, until recently, one needed a special permit to use a pro-looking camera in Red Square, but that law was changed. In the NYC subways, it is advisable to carry the MTA's rules regarding photography as a protection against ignorant, bullying police. The problem with all point and shoots is that in places like the subway where you want to take candids, you need the low light and background blurring capability of a large sensor camera and the speed of a pro lens. For those concerned about the weight of such cameras, I have walked all day in NYC and Bangkok with a D300 and a D700 with the 70-200 lens with perfect comfort because I was using the CameraSlingers strap which puts all the weight on your back and not on your neck or shoulders.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

2588,110,0,"ultrabike","Chris,  This is a very interesting blu ray player.   1) Is it possible to play MKVs through CIFS with it?  2) Can this player handle AVIs, M2TS, TS and VOB/IFO/ISO through CIFS? 3) Can this player handle high definition audio (Dolby and DTS) in MKV and M2TS containers through CIFS?  I've seen a lot of reviews about its DLNA capabilities which I don't care about given its media content limitations (MKVs are out of the questions through DLNA). However CIFS is a completely different ball game, and this together with its NTFS support though USB makes it a very attractive device to me.   Depending on the files it can playback through CIFS, which should be the same as through USB, this device is potentially a true blu ray / streaming media player hybrid that would put the WDTV and similar to shame. Specially given it's support for Netflix, Vudu and the such.

2605,110,0,"Chris Boylan","Robert,  It's actually much more difficult to find region-free Blu-ray players than it is to find region-free DVD players (and yes, I'm talking about a Blu-ray player having the ability to play back non-US DVDs).  OPPO's DVD players, for example, could be hacked easily enough to be region free, but OPPO's Blu-ray players could not.  I think that if you want a true region-free player, you will need to buy one that has been physically modified by a third party to support region-free capabilities.  Pretty sure there is no easy way to hack the BD570 to support multi-region playback.    As for NTFS support, the answer appears to be Yes, but with a minor caveat.  From the owner's manual:  This player supports USB flash drive/external HDD formatted in FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS when accessing files (music, photo, movie). However, for BD-LIVE and Audio CD recording, only FAT16 and FAT32 formats are supported. Use the USB flash drive/external HDD formatted in either FAT16 or FAT32 when using BD-LIVE and Audio CD recording.     Hope that helps,  -CB",0,0,,,,,,,,,

MY Samsung LCD produces an amazingly sharp picture which seemed slightly better on the LG. On newer non blu ray DVDs both players produced an extremely good picture - a tie in my opinion. On older DVDs the LG does not automatically make them full screen and unfortunately I never tried older DVDs on the Sony. As I don't know about your DVD collection this may or may not be important. I also felt the picture was not as sharp on older DVDs - those formatted for a cathode ray TV but it could be a function of those old DVD's. Perhaps you should take an old formatted DVD to a video retailer and see how it plays on both machines.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

If that's the case it's a plus.  I don't think it makes any sense to automatically warp 4:3 content to fit a 16:9 screen.  It should be shown with side bars unless the user opts to warp it.

2622,112,1,"David Becker","Hello, Diane.  You seem to have a lot of confusion about how this works - and you are not alone.  It can be very complicated.  I'll try to explain at least the basics, one small bite at a time.  1) DirecTV and the LG BluRay player have NOTHING to do with each other.  They're completely independent and either one is going to do what it does without the other.  2) DirecTV gets its programming from satellites, not on the phone line.  The dish they put on your roof is the satellite antenna.  A phone line is usually connected to the DirecTV box to allow billing information to be sent to DirecTV.    3) You ask if anything records.  Yes, your DirecTV DVR records.  DVR means Digital Video Recorder.  On DirecTV, select channel number 1.  There are videos that explain all about using DirecTV, including how to use the DVR to record any show on DirecTV.  4) You have to subscribe to Netflix.  If you already have, you should be able to watch ""instant"" streaming movies from Netflix on your computer.  5) You say you have a broadband internet connection.  That's what you need to use Netflix, so that's good.  Connecting the LG BluRay to your internet connection will allow it to receive Netflix.  6) If you want play DVDs or BluRay disks, the LG BluRay BD570 is a good choice - but you said ""ALL I WANT IS NETFLIX""!  If that's true, then you should look at the Roku box.  Search Amazon for ""Roku HD Streaming Player"".  For $70 this will give you Netflix and tons of other internet content - more than the LG BluRay.  7) With either the LG BluRay or the Roku box, the obstacle is going to be connecting it to your internet connection.  There are two methods - wired or wireless.  If your internet router (the box that is connected between the wall and your computer) is within easy reach of your TV, you can just use an Ethernet cable.  This will only cost a few dollars and gives you the best possible connection.  For most people, their router is not in the same room as the TV and they need to use a wireless connection.  If you already have wireless internet connection in your house, you are all set.  Just set up the LG BluRay or Roku and follow the instructions to connect it wirelessly.    8) If you don't have a wireless connection already, that's where it gets complicated. You will need to purchase a wireless internet router that will transmit your internet connection throughout your house wirelessly.  Search Amazon for ""Belkin Wireless N+ 802.11n Router"".  Highly recommended, only $45.  DO NOT TRY TO SET THIS UP YOURSELF!  It's too complicated.  See the next item...  9) You should try to find someone locally who can help you with these things, especially if you have to purchase and set up a wireless internet router.  I'm sure someone you know has a teenager or college student in their family who loves to play with these kinds of things and would be willing to help you.  Ask around - don't feel embarrassed; almost everyone needs some help with this kind of technology.  Good luck - you will LOVE watching Netflix on your HDTV!",0,0,,,,,,,,,

Thanks for all your good info.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
2626,112,1,"David Becker","I suspect that Hulu doesn't want to allow PlayOn to serve Hulu content to DLNA devices.  They have blocked Boxee, GoogleTV, etc. from accessing Hulu.  Those firmware updates were probably the result of Hulu enforcing their will on manufacturers. As of now, the LG BD570 BluRay works fine with PlayOn including Hulu, but there are no guarantees for the future.   The BD570 firmware on my machine is identified as Main Version = BD.8.31.317.C.  Servo Version is H80594 (H08SAN).  This is the version that was installed by automatic update when I connected the player about a month ago.  There is no newer update available. My version of PlayOn is also the newest available: 3.0.31.1337. Good luck!",0,0,,,,,,,,,
2627,112,0,"D. Farris","You're probably right about Hulu ""enforcing their will.""  On the one hand, I can't really blame them for trying to keep their free content off the TV screen, which is obviously going against their TOS.  On the other, it irks me to buy a DLNA device which can apparently be rendered incompatible at the snap of Hulu's finger, so to speak.  Thereby not only keeping me from watching Hulu (which I very rarely do in any case, or any of the ""official"" channels for that matter, utilizing for the most part 3rd party developer plugins/scripts) but any/all other PlayOn content as well.  If they want to block their own stuff, go for it, but how do they have the right to disable the whole thing?  Sorry, that was more than you wanted/needed to hear.  Excuse the rant, and thanks so much for sharing your information.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
2628,112,0,"David Becker","It doesn't seem to me that Hulu could block anything other than the Hulu content.  They do this at their server by identifying the browser that is requesting the content.  Hopefully you'll find the right combination to let you enjoy the PlayOn content.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
2629,112,0,"David L. Gillespie","I have the same firmware and Playon versions, Hulu works fine for me. What DOESN'T work is that the BD570 powers off at the end of whatever I am watching through Playon- doesn't matter from what site (Hulu, ESPN, NBC, CBS...) and sometimes it will power off after abt 2 hours of live stream from ESPN3.. but not all the time.

Not a terrible thing, I suppose, but is that the way it's supposed to work?  [Note that if I hit STOP on the remote before the video is completely finished, I can navigate to other shows or movies just fine. And if I press the >>| button, it skips to the next next video just as expected. It only turns off if I let the video run all the way to the end.

2632,112,1,"Nimmala","Hi David.. Thanks a lot for your time..  I tried Samsung 5900 and Sony S570.. they were good with blu rays and online content... But they Suck at DLNA.. don't play many formats and can't forward while playing from DLNA server.. What about LG bd570? May i know your DLNA story? (Does it play most of the formats? Can you seek forward/rewind a file? or by time) (Am not asking about files from USB drive.. u already listed it in review) I may watch blurays like twice or thrice a month but DLNA is very important to me to watch my Movie library from PC/NAS.  Thanks again..",1,0,,,,,,,,,
2633,112,1,"David Becker","The BD570 DLNA works very well for me.  The only file format it doesn't seem to like is WMV - those don't even show up on the file list.  AVI, MKV, and MP4 all work great.  I haven't formally tried different internal encoding methods, but I've played files from many sources and everything (except WMV) works perfectly.  Different resolutions are managed correctly, using my 1080 display to the fullest with appropriate letterboxing and no distortion.  The DLNA implementation recognizes shared folders from Windows XP and Vista with no special effort.  Navigating folders and file lists is fast and straightforward. When playing files directly from a shared folder (or from USB or disc for that matter), you can fast forward and rewind at multiple speeds and the visual keeps up perfectly.  If you display the ""Info"" box, you'll see the current time and full length which also follows the fast forward/rewind so you can easily hit any time you want.  All this is without using any special server software.  I am NOT using the software included with the player - I can't see any possible reason to use it when all the files play fine when accessed directly.  As I said earlier, I do often use the PlayOn server software for its ability to access Hulu, but never to play files that I have stored locally.  Here's what the owners manual says about file format compatibility - I don't think you are going to run into many things it won't play other than WMV...  ==================================  Available File extensions: "".jpg"", "".jpeg"", "".png"", "".avi"", "".divx"", "".mpg"", "".mpeg"", "".mkv"", "".mp4"", "".mp3"", "".wma"", "".wav""  Available file extensions differ depending on the DLNA servers.

Yes, I also listen to music, but not that much. I have Windows 7 on my computer and am more a PC person than an Apple person. I know Apple products are better quality than any other but I don't want the hassle of converting files and I'm also concerned about the disk vs solid state issue - although I really want the large capacity. I currently own two Zen players, one is 8 GB and one is 16 GB to which I've added another 5 GB. The ZEN player is nice, but the maximum capacity is 64 GB. I also have a Zune 30 which I bought used on Amazon. What the seller failed to mention (or maybe he didn't know) it doesn't work with windows 7. I don't know why. It seems MSFT should make their products work together more. So anyway, I'm trying to find some compelling advice about which player I should buy. I've also looked at odd but enormous players like ARCHOS but I haven't seen much on this. This reviewer seems very knowledgeable. What would you recommend for someone like me? I'm leaning toward the Zune 120 but I'm concerned about the software. I really understand the Zen software and it works well. The Zune 30 will not allow me to load more than 3 GB of files even though it's a 30 GB player. With ZEN, you simply ""Add Media"", navigate to the media you want to add and click on it. Or more simply, just choose the media you want to add and right click to ""Send"" and choose Send to Zen player. With the Zune, all you can do is choose it to ""Synch"" some or all of your music files or other files - but even if you choose All it doesn't Synch all. Strange.",1,0,,,,,,,,,

1192,34,0,"WolfPup","Great review, and I agree about the interface.  The iPod classic has the best interface on the market, easily.  The nano's is functionally more or less the same, but the scroll wheel is way too small to use easily.  The 4th/5th gen nano is actually worse in that regard than the first 3 generations.  Meanwhile the iPod touch of course has a touch interface for everything but adjusting volume, meaning playing, pausing, fast forwarding, scrolling through music, etc. is all much harder to do on a touch (let alone in the car).  Smart playlists don't currently work right on the iPod touch either (though they seem to fix and break things on that with every software update).  So...I'm a pretty big fan of the classic.  I THINK I'm going with another touch only because I do actually use the (non-syncable) notepad and timer frequently.  It would be cool if the classic had the new FM radio that the nano has (and I wouldn't mind a classic design that used flash instead of a hard drive...but I want the same large interface and control wheel!)",1,0,,,,,,,,,

1207,34,0,"WolfPup","So you're going to be connecting the iPod's headphone jack to your stereo?  Playing music that way?  Technically every setting you can use except AIFF (I think this is Apple's equivalent of WAV), WAV, and Apple Lossless Encoder are lousy.   That said, high bit rate MP3 or AAC are hard or nearly impossible for most people to tell apart from the original.  It sounds like AAC/iTunes Plus is a pretty high quality setting to use...it's 256Kb/s, which is the same used by Apple's iTunes store now.  Depending on your equipment and your ear, you may not be able to tell any difference from the CDs.  Apple Lossless is the only setting it supports that both compresses the music, but doesn't lose any of the data (supposedly).  I personally use AAC 320KB/s, so slightly higher quality...I just use it because that's the highest quality level AAC the iPod supports, not for any particularly great reason.  I also turn on error correction, which it seems like on modern drives doesn't really impact performance, although on some older drives it had a huge performance hit.  Regarding records...hmm...I've never tried to do that, and I'm not sure of the best way.  What operating system is this?   I'm not sure if you can record directly in to iTunes...I don't think so or at least haven't.  You might be able to run the player out to your computer's mic jack, and capture it in a high quality format in a program on your computer, then transfer it to iTunes and your iPod.  Possibly the mic jack wouldn't be good enough, so you might need some kind of USB capture device, depending on the quality of that jack (for that matter, I'm not even sure off hand if those jacks support stereo input...)  It should be doable, though at best time consuming, having to manually play in all your records.  On a completely unrelated note, I LOVE that we've started seeing record releases again!  Amazon has quite a lot...I'm not sure who makes players anymore though.  If I actually listened to music much, I'm sure I'd buy one and probably start buying music in that format :)",0,0,,,,,,,,,

You'd think they COULD make a great sounding device that works well (especially Apple), but that's where consumer devices and people's willingness to put up with it has gone. It they can make it cheaper, they will.   While my iPod doesn't sound bad, it does sound very flat when compared to listening to the CD version of songs. I just did an A/B comparison with remastered old Jo Walsh CD (encoded in AAC 256 kbps VBR), using speakers rather than headphones, on my fairly good quality Yamaha RX-V3000 receiver and a Sony SACD333 CD player as the B comparison (the CD was not a SACD disc).

IOW, is it a proprietary Apple compression?>>>  No, the only Apple-only format in iTunes/the iPod is Apple loseless (at least I assume nothing else plays it).  MP3 is MPEG-1, AAC is MPEG-4.  They're both open for anyone to license.  Almost anything on a computer should play AAC, and at least some portable players besides the iPod can play AAC, although I'd guess there are probably some that still can't.  <<<Do you use Variable Bit Rate? How about High Efficiency Encoding? And what does the Sample Rate have to do with anything? Thanks for any answers you folks can provide.>>>  I've JUST started using Variable Bit Rate on the newer CDs I buy, although the older ones I didn't.  It's supposed to improve sound quality, as I understand it, by allocating more space to parts of the music/sound that need it...I guess.  I've always been sort of confused by how that setting works...like if it's on, does that mean the ""Stereo Bit Rate"" averages out to that level?  Is that the minimum?  The maximum?  I'm not entirely sure, though it seems like some songs end up slightly higher than what's selected.  I don't know that it really makes a difference when you're using a high bit rate anyway, but I guess it's better so I've just got it turned on now.  ""High Efficiency"" is supposed to help with encoding at bit rates below 128Kb/s, but not have an effect above that, so I just leave it off.  The sample rate I guess could be left at 44.100 or Auto (which should default it to 44.100 at high bit rates I'd assume), since that's the same as what CDs use.  It's just the number of times per second the audio source is recorded...if I'm saying that right.

1222,35,1,"nozer says","From Wikipedia: Capacity measurements A disassembled and labeled 1997 hard drive. All major components were placed on a mirror, which created the symmetrical reflections.  Raw unformatted capacity of a hard disk drive is usually quoted with SI prefixes (metric system prefixes), incrementing by powers of 1000; today that usually means gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB). This is conventional for data speeds and memory sizes which are not inherently manufactured in power of two sizes, as RAM and Flash memory are. Hard disks by contrast have no inherent binary size as capacity is determined by number of heads, tracks and sectors.  This can cause some confusion because some operating systems may report the formatted capacity of a hard drive using binary prefix units which increment by powers of 1024.  A one terabyte (1 TB) disk drive would be expected to hold around 1 trillion bytes (1,000,000,000,000) or 1000 GB; and indeed most 1 TB hard drives will contain slightly more than this number. However some operating system utilities would report this as around 931 GB or 953,674 MB. (The actual number for a formatted capacity will be somewhat smaller still, depending on the file system). Following are the several ways of reporting one Terabyte. SI prefixes (hard drive)  equivalent  Binary prefixes (OS)  equivalent 1 TB (Terabyte)  1 * 10004 B  0.9095 TB (Terabyte)  0.9095 * 10244 B 1000 GB (Gigabyte)  1000 * 10003 B  931.3 GB (Gigabyte)  931.3 * 10243 B",0,0,,,,,,,,,

I'd like to know, how often do you play your iPods?  Do you play them every day or just once in a while?  I played mine everyday at work on a dock with speakers, and in my vehicle, which happens to have an audio receiver made for iPod, and occasionally on the Bose dock.  To me, I consider that normal use.  To you, Apple, and others, that may be considered extreme use.  I certainly thought that since Apple designed the iPod to be portable, i.e., to be carried around from place to place, and to be worn on your body while jogging, running, etc., that it would be able to endure ""normal"" wear and tear.  The dock I used at work for the iPod has a remote control, so there's no contact with the wheel.  The controls on the audio device for the iPod in my vehicle are on the receiver, so once again, there's no contact with the iPod.  So tell me, BatznDaBelfry, how my iPods could crash so soon if it's not poor quality?  Also, you can cut the sarcasm in your post.

I use every one of my iPods daily because music is my line of work and staying competitive means keeping abreast of the deluge of music that continues to enter the market.

1274,39,1,"B. Porter","Have you considered one of your other devices could have been the cause of failure for all the iPods?  It's entirely possible that either your dock at work, your car connection, or your Bose dock or anything else you've plugged your iPod into are faulty.  If one of those devices sent an electrical surge through your iPod, it could have fried the hard drive, the battery, or any of the circuitry inside.  It just seems odd that out of the millions of iPods out there that people don't have problems with, you had four in short succession.  Having that many in such a short period just makes the scenario I present much more likely.  There's a general rule around where I work for conducting engineering investigations, don't make any assumptions until you've exhausted all possibilities.  Basically, don't come to a conclusion on a failure mode until you examined all of the components that have an interface and interact with the failed component.  I'm not saying that is definitely the case though.  However unlikely, it is entirely possible that you received four bad units.  It's just a suggestion and something you may want to consider before blaming Apple and your iPods.

I'm afraid that I can not bring the following to you gently: the syncing is just an OPTION of the iPod in iTunes, a pr├⌐-setting for mainly beginners [which you are, concerning the iPod] who in most cases have a small collection of music, video etc. [which you have not]. Or for people that don't want to spend to much time organizing their files into all kind of categories, which you evidently DO want to do. Or for the ones that simply don't care, as long as there is a heap of music et all on their iPod. You clearly do care. It really amazes me that nobody told you that you:  A - Can manage your files manually in iTunes, which is just a case of dragging and dropping [to and on your iPod therein] and that you: B - Can turn the automatic [re]organisation of your iPod-files by iTunes OFF.   Changing these settings is simple [and so is -VERY much so- managing your iPod manually. The explaining in this case 'How To' is a bit af a problem because my iTunes and iPods are in Dutch. Like in this situation the use of English in programs is often preferable but since I'm Dutch and my language is one of only seven languages that is used as far as the most remote settings and levels in iTunes and on the iPod...Anyhow: click the second category in the upper left side of iTunes, choose [I guess these are the correct translations] 'Preferences' and then 'Devices' [second from the right] to switch auto-syncing off and then 'Advanced' [totally on the right] to do the same with auto-[re]organizing of your files.

Thank you so much for the attention to detail you gave when giving me a insider's crash course for all the settings.  One thing I'll say for the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00267A7QC"">Cowon S9 32 GB Video MP3 Player with Touchscreen (Titanium Black)</a>, this is my first high definition video device. The screen is truly amazing. There are half a dozen things I could say about the screen and visual effects alone. However, there is one thing pressing on my mind.  I had no problem importing my playlists into the JetAudio desktop program. But, the Cowan S9 portable device doesn't show my playlists. In fact, there is no folder for playlists. The folders on the portable are: Audible, Documents, Flash, Music, Pictures, PodcastReady, Recordings, System and Video. I tried creating a Playlist folder. However, the player must not recognize the .M3U file extension. It imported copies of the original MP3 files of all songs on my playlist from my computer. In so doing, it disregarded the order of the songs.  Technology has given us things over the years that I've grown attached to. Palm Pilots (or PDAs in general) were around for few years, then all but disappeared (in their original low-tech format). As far as my Palm Pilot went, I only needed the address book, calendar, notes, clock and calculator. I don't need it to have a Windows operating system. I don't need online access. It doesn't have to also be a cell phone. Now, with playlists, are these being phased out?   I consider myself tech savvy above average. So, merely importing music into a new MP3 device and setting up my playlists should be child's play. I don't understand why this suddenly got harder than calculus.  Any suggestions, Johan?",0,0,,,,,,,,,
1296,40,1,"Johan Peter","If I understand the definition of Playlist correctly, it's certainly there and I know where [though I only partly know how to manage it, and only on the S9 itself, not the Jet program] but here is a typical example of the S9's rather excentric language, meaning that the symbols that are used make no sense at all for 'us' Westeners. It's probably something Asian: the sign-culture, not the people. You'll find 'playlists' by tapping: Menu, then Music, then the symbol on the upper left on the screen, then the symbol down on the left with the horizontal line with the arrow under it [yes, what the hello has that to do with playlists?]. Et voila! Maybe you have to 'Flip' first, down on the right. I hope you now have found what you were looking for. Between playlists 'Albums, Artists' etc you find the actual word 'playlists' and you can fill it up by tapping the rectangle with the cross when you play or have selected a particular song/track. You can see the result by tapping playlist and then again the symbol on the upper left side. That's as far as I have come concerning the subject 'playlist', I think in songs and as long as I can find them quickly, it's fine with me...Sorry. Btw: the symbol with the rectangle with the arrow on top pointing to the left and right is fun and convenient. And again, not very logical. Shake to the left: the next[!?] song will play, to the right: the previous one.  Yeah, the screen of the S9 is kind of famous [in circles that know it exists!] for being unprecedented. Compared with it, the Classic's little plastic one is well... pathetic... The materials of which the S9 is made are from a totally different class. The exterior is even put together with screws! [hidden under little silicone dots on the back corners]. In that sense the high European price is justified [they have to keep it low in the US because of Apple's de-facto monopoly probably]. Btw: it dropped from 440 to 370 USD on the Euro-Amazons recently, again because of 'The New Generations Of Apples Attack' I suppose...  I find there is one drawback with the screen though: since films are made with the knowledge that black is never really black on normal screens [more like light shining through black tinted glass(es), which actually is the case], the lighting-crews of films do their jobs with that in mind. Which in the case of the S9 can make films rather darkish in normal daylight. Not in sunlight though, it explodes from the screen like firework splendor. And though seemingly dark sometimes, none of the remakable capacity for details is lost, so it's a question of getting used to.  Hope this was useful!  JP",0,0,,,,,,,,,

1304,41,0.972973,"A Looney Old Coot","I've owned my new Nano for about a month now, and here's my two cents worth:  The new Nano replaced one I bought five years ago, which I use only at the gym.  No longer needing an armband is a big benefit for me, because I kept wearing them out and having to buy replacements.  (Perspiration and regular washing really takes a toll on those things!)  Being able to simply clip the Nano to my clothing is quite convenient, and I appreciate that the clip is all metal, like the case, so it's almost impossible to break.  I would say the touch-screen is somewhat better than using the old click-wheel.  For example, it's easier to scroll through music to find a particular tune.  FYI, I have large hands and fingers, but have little trouble using the touch interface.  My biggest complaint is that the screen turns itself off after a very brief period, and this ""feature"" is not adjustable.  So whenever I want to skip a song, I have to first push the ON button to turn the screen back on.  Only then can I touch the screen to advance to the next tune.  Perhaps this is intended to increase battery life, but it irritates me the more I use it.  Dear Mr. Jobs, if you're listening, please do something about this ""feature"".  Having separate volume control buttons is definitely an improvement, especially since it's not necessary to turn the screen back on to use them.  If there were a way to use these buttons to also skip songs, my primary complaint would be resolved.  In conclusion, I would say the new iPod Nano is a very nice upgrade from the Shuffle.  IMO, it's the best music-only player on the market.  It's also by far the most expensive.  But if a tiny music-only player is what you need, and you can justify the cost, I definitely recommend it.

Regarding controls, for me it's a wash between the old wheel and a touch screen. The new nano is smaller, but it's not like the old nano is big. And did I mention that the old nano is less expensive?   I'll wait a few days to see if anyone can tell me why I should pay more for the new nano. Right now I'm inclined to get the older one because I'll pay less and get more. If this new nano was maybe fifty dollars cheaper than the old nano, I might consider getting it instead.  Anybody want to contribute their two cents?",0,0,,,,,,,,,
1307,41,1,"A Looney Old Coot","Dear Mr. Mason: See my two cents post above!  I would say that, unless you have a specific need for such a tiny unit, buy the 5th gen model.  My daughter and son-in-law were waiting to see the new model, but each bought an older one because they're cheaper and have more features.  They're very happy with them.  Don't wait too long though, remaining stock isn't likely to last much longer.",0,0,,,,,,,,,

You know, I've been waiting a long time for a ""shuffle"" with a display, and I thought this was it - UNTIL I saw the price! :-)  There is a part of me which can't believe that Apple would no longer offer a nano that can't play videos, but maybe they'll tell us that's what the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad are for! :-)",0,0,,,,,,,,,
1309,41,0,"Edward","I only have a shuffle and been looking to get a nano for a while and was thinking about for Christmas. When I look at the 6th gen I am surprised they labeled it a nano. It is more like an ungraded shuffle.  All the reasons I wanted the 5th gen nano are not met with this version.  I honestly don't understand why this released this as a nano..",0,0,,,,,,,,,
1310,41,0,"Steven Mason","I agree, Edward. A nano should be able to play video, and a shuffle, even if they add a display to it, should be significantly less expensive than a nano. This is Apple's biggest blunder in the iPod line. Now if you want to watch video, Apple might tell us to buy an iPod Touch, iPhone, or iPad. To which I say ""fuggedaboutit!"" There's no way I'm gonna pay $150 for a shuffle with a display. If this is where Apple is going, they will push me to an MP3 player.",0,0,,,,,,,,,
1311,41,0.33333334,"A Looney Old Coot","Apple seems to be in a state of denial and confusion.  Their iPod product line has become a mishmash of confusing and conflicting products and prices.  The Nano is only one example.  Consider the $250 iPod Classic, which has a 160GB capacity but no camera, and a screen smaller than a $230 iPod Touch!  Who has 40,000 songs they need to carry with them?  Who wants to watch movies on a 2.5"" square screen?  I was hoping this generation of the Nano would be like the Touch, only smaller.  But if Apple did that, who would buy the Touch?  Whoops, can't do that!  Right now Apple seems more concerned with maintaining a bloated product line than worrying about what their customers want or think.  Apple will surely straighten all this out eventually, but not right now.  Or perhaps they're trying to jettison all their newfound iPod customers who aren't die-hard Apple Computer fans.  Who needs those Microsoft Windows users anyway?  They've had almost ten years to see the light...   Time's up!",0,0,,,,,,,,,

It is compact and has pleanty of battery life for a few movies. The newest nano does not have video therefore its just another MP3 player. Ill pass on this one.",1,0,,,,,,,,,

Save yourself some money, buy a Zune HD for less than the 6th gen Nano and get more functionality.  You can even keep iTunes if you like.  The Zune software will pick up songs and videos from any directory on your hard drive you specify.",1,0,,,,,,,,,
1319,41,1,"Steven Mason","I'll be looking at those Zunes next time I'm shopping for a player!  Apple recently increased the price for the 5th gen nano, to make it more expensive than the new one, because they saw what was happening. :-)",0,0,,,,,,,,,

Can't find a new one(5th gen) for less than $200, unless I go the e-bay route. Huge disappointment-not sure if I can manage that little one that is out now-",1,0,,,,,,,,,
